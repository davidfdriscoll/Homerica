          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>], goddess, sing
            it, of Achilles, son of Peleus—  <seg rend="subscript">2</seg> disastrous [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">oulomenē</foreign>] anger that made countless pains [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">algea</foreign>] for the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">3</seg> and
            many steadfast lives [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhai</foreign>] it drove down to
              Hādēs, <seg rend="subscript">4</seg> heroes’ lives, but their bodies it made prizes
            for dogs [5] and for all birds, and the Will of Zeus was reaching its fulfillment
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>]— <seg rend="subscript">6</seg> sing
            starting from the point where the two—I now see it—first had a falling out, engaging in
            strife [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">eris</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">7</seg> I mean,
            [Agamemnon] the son of Atreus, lord of men, and radiant Achilles. <seg rend="subscript"
              >8</seg> So, which one of the gods was it who impelled the two to fight with each
            other in strife [eris]? <seg rend="subscript">9</seg> It was [Apollo] the son of Leto
            and of Zeus. For he [= Apollo], infuriated at the king [= Agamemnon], [10] caused an
            evil disease to arise throughout the mass of warriors, and the people were getting
            destroyed, because the son of Atreus had dishonored Khrysēs his priest. Now Khrysēs had
            come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great
            ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>]: moreover he bore in his hand the
            scepter of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath [15] and he besought the Achaeans,
            but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs. </p>
          <p>“Sons of Atreus,” he cried, “and all other Achaeans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus
            grant you to destroy the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; [20] but free
            my daughter, and accept a ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>] for her, in
            reverence to Apollo, son of Zeus.” </p>
          <p>Then the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking
            the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, son of Atreus [25] who spoke fiercely
            to him and sent him roughly away. “Old man,” said he, “let me not find you tarrying
            about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your scepter of the god and your wreath shall
            profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old [30] in my house at Argos
            far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my bed; so go, and do
            not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.” </p>
          <p>The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the
            sounding sea [35] and prayed apart to King Apollo, whom lovely fine-haired Leto had
            borne. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the silver bow, you who protects Khrysē and holy
            Killa and rules Tenedos with your might, hear me O Sminthian God of Plague Apollo. If I
            have ever decked your temple with garlands, [40] or burned your thigh-pieces in fat of
            bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the
            Danaans.”</p>
          <p>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of
            Olympus, [45] with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, <seg rend="subscript"
              >46</seg> and on his shoulders the arrows made a sound with the rage <seg
              rend="subscript">47</seg> that trembled within him; his face was as dark as
              night. <seg rend="subscript">48</seg> He sat himself down away from the ships, and he
            shot his arrow in the midst of them: <seg rend="subscript">49</seg> there was a terrible
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">deinos</foreign>] sound from the silver bow. [50] First he
            smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people
            themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning. For nine whole days he
            shot his arrows among the people, but upon the tenth day Achilles called them together
            in assembly— [55] moved to do so by Hera, the white-armed goddess, who saw the Achaeans
            in their death-throes and had compassion upon them. Then, when they were assembled,
            fleet Achilles rose and spoke among them. </p>
          <p>“Son of Atreus,” said he, “I deem that we should now [60] turn roving home if we would
            escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and pestilence at once. Let us ask
            some priest or prophet [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>], or some reader of
            dreams (for dreams, too, are of Zeus) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo is so angry,
            and say [65] whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or hecatomb that we have
            not offered, and whether he will accept the savor of lambs and goats without blemish, so
            as to take away the plague from us.” </p>
          <p>With these words he sat down, and Kalkhas son of Thestor, wisest of seers, [70] who
            knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He it was who had guided the
            Achaeans with their fleet to Ilion, through the prophecies with which Phoebus Apollo had
            inspired him. With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus: </p>
          <p>“Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you bid me tell you about the [75] anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of King Apollo, the Arch-Destroyer, I will therefore
            do so; but consider first and swear that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed,
            for I know that I shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the
            Achaeans are in subjection. [80] A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king,
            who even if he swallows his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has taken
            it. Consider, therefore, whether or not you will protect me.” </p>
          <p>And Achilles, the great runner, answered, [85] “Fear not, but speak as it is given to
            you by the gods. I swear by Apollo, Kalkhas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles you
            reveal to us, that not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I yet
            live to look upon the face of the earth— [90] no, not even if you name Agamemnon
              himself, <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> who now boasts to be by far the best of the
            Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>At that the brave seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] spoke boldly. “The
            god,” he said, “is not angry about either a vow or a hecatomb, but for his priest’s
            sake, whom Agamemnon has dishonored, [95] in that he would neither free his daughter nor
            take a ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>] for her. <seg rend="subscript"
              >96</seg> For that reason the far-shooter gave—and will give—pains [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">algea</foreign>] upon us, <seg rend="subscript">97</seg> and he will
            not remove the disgraceful devastation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">loigos</foreign>] from
            the Danaans <seg rend="subscript">98</seg> until Agamemnon has restored the girl without
            fee or ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>] to her father, and has sent a
            holy hecatomb [100] to Khrysē. Thus we may perhaps appease him.” </p>
          <p>With these words he sat down, and the warlord Agamemnon, son of Atreus, rose in anger.
            His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire [105] as he scowled at Kalkhas
            and said, “Seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] of evil, you never yet
            prophesied good things concerning me, but have always loved to foretell that which was
            evil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come prophesying
            among the Danaans, and saying [110] that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take
            a ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>] for this girl, the daughter of
            Khrysēs. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I prefer her to my own
            wife Clytemnestra, whom I courted when young, whose peer she is in [115] both form and
            feature, in intelligence and accomplishments. Still I will give her up if I must, for I
            want the people to live, not die; but you must find me a prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >geras</foreign>] instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without one. This is
            not well; [120] for you see, all of you, that my prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >geras</foreign>] is to go elsewhere.” </p>
          <p>And swift godlike Achilles answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all
            humankind, how shall the magnanimous Achaeans find you another prize [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>]? We have no common store from which to take one.
            [125] Those we took from the cities have been divided up; we cannot disallow the awards
            that have been made already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Zeus
            grants that we destroy the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.” </p>
          <p>[130] Then the warlord Agamemnon said, “Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not
            thus get the better of me in matters of the mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>]. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me. Are you to
            keep your own prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>], while I sit tamely under
            my loss and give up the girl at your bidding? [135] Let the Achaeans find me a prize
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>] in fair exchange to my liking, or I will
            come and take your own, or that of Ajax or of Odysseus; and to whomsoever I may come
            shall regret my coming. [140] But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the
            present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put
            a hecatomb on board, and let us send Khrysēis of the lovely cheeks also; further, let
            some chief man among us be in command, [145] either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or godlike
            Odysseus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer
            sacrifice and appease the anger of the Arch-Destroyer god.” </p>
          <p>Achilles scowled at him and answered, “You are steeped in insolence and lust of gain.
            [150] With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding, either on foray or in
            open fighting? I came to make war here not because the Trojans are responsible [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aitioi</foreign>] for any wrong committed against me. I have no
            quarrel with them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, [155] nor cut down my
            harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space,
            both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, shameless one, for your pleasure,
            not ours—to gain satisfaction [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] from the Trojans
            for you—you with the looks of a dog—and for Menelaos. [160] You forget this, and
            threaten to rob me of the prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>] for which I
            have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans
            destroy any rich city of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>] as you do, [165] though it is my hands that do the
            better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest, and
            I must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labor of
            fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better
            [170] for me to return home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonored to gather
            gold and substance for you.” </p>
          <p>And the warlord Agamemnon answered, “Leave if you will, I shall make you no entreaties
            to stay you. I have others here [175] who will do me honor, and above all Zeus, the lord
            of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are, <seg rend="subscript"
              >177</seg> strife [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">eris</foreign>] is always dear to you, as
            well as wars and battles. So what if you are strong? Was it not a god that made you so?
            Go home, then, with your ships and comrades [180] to lord it over the beloved Myrmidons.
            I care neither for you nor for your anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kotos</foreign>];
            and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Khrysēis from me, I shall send her
            with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent and [185] take your own
            beautiful prize Brisēis, that you may learn how much stronger I am than you are, <seg
              rend="subscript">186</seg> so that any one else will draw back <seg rend="subscript"
              >187</seg> from saying that he is equal to [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">isos</foreign>]
            me [=Agamemnon] and from making himself equal to [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >homoios</foreign>] me face to face.” <seg rend="subscript">188</seg> Thus he [=
            Agamemnon] spoke. </p>
          <p>And the son of Peleus [= Achilles] felt grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >akhos</foreign>], and the heart <seg rend="subscript">189</seg> within his shaggy chest
            was divided [190] whether to draw the sharp sword at his thigh <seg rend="subscript"
              >191</seg> and make the others get up and scatter while he kills the son of Atreus [=
              Agamemnon], <seg rend="subscript">192</seg> or whether to check his anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kholos</foreign>] and restrain his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>]. While he was thus of two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword
            from its scabbard, Athena came down [195] from the sky (for white-armed Hera had sent
            her in the love she bore for them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his golden
            hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in
            amazement, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she was [200]
            Athena. “Why are you here,” said he, “daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus? To see the outrage
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>] of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell
            you—and it shall surely be— [205] he shall pay for this insolence with his life.” </p>
          <p>And Athena said, “I come from the sky, if you will hear me, to bid you stop your anger
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>]. Hera has sent me, who cares for both of
            you alike. [210] Cease, then, this quarreling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him
            if you will, with words, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you—and it shall
            surely be—that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid by reason of
            this present outrage [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hubris</foreign>]. Hold, therefore, and
            obey.” </p>
          <p>[215] “Goddess,” answered swift Achilles, the great runner, “whatever anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kholos</foreign>] a man may have, he must do as you two command him.
            This will be best, for the gods ever hear the prayers of him who has obeyed them.” </p>
          <p>He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, [220] and thrust it back into the
            scabbard as Athena bade him. Then she went back to Olympus among the other gods
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimones</foreign>], and to the house of aegis-bearing
            Zeus. </p>
          <p>But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for he had not yet
            desisted from his anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kholos</foreign>]. [225]
            “Wine-bibber,” he cried, “you with the looks of a dog and the heart of a deer, you never
            dare to go out with the army of warriors in fight, nor yet with our chosen (best of the
            Achaeans) men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do death itself. You had rather go
            round and [230] rob his prizes from any man who contradicts you. You devour your people,
            for you are king over a feeble folk. <seg rend="subscript">232</seg> This could be the
            last time, son of Atreus, that you will be hurling insults. <seg rend="subscript"
              >233</seg> And here’s another thing. I’ll tell it to you, and I will swear on top of
            it a great oath: <seg rend="subscript">234</seg> I swear by this scepter [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">skēptron</foreign>] that I’m holding here, this scepter that will
            never again have leaves and branches [235] growing out of it—and it never has—ever since
            it left that place in the mountains where it was cut down. <seg rend="subscript"
              >236</seg> It will never flourish again, since the bronze implement has stripped
              it <seg rend="subscript">237</seg> of its leaves and its bark. Now the sons of the
            Achaeans carry it around, <seg rend="subscript">238</seg> holding it in their hands
            whenever they act as makers of judgments [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >dikaspoloi</foreign>], judging what are and what are not divine laws [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign> plural], <seg rend="subscript">239</seg> which they
            uphold, taking their authority from Zeus. This is going to be a big oath. [240] So here
            is what I say, and I say it most solemnly: the day will come when there will be a
            longing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pothē</foreign>] for Achilles, and it will overcome
            the sons of the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">241</seg> overcome them all. When that
            day comes, there is no way you will be able, no matter how much grief you feel [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akh-nusthai</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">242</seg> to keep them
            away from harm. And that is the time when many will be killed at the hands of Hector the
              man-killer, <seg rend="subscript">243</seg> dying as they fall to the ground. And you
            will have in your insides a heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] that will
            be all torn up for you, <seg rend="subscript">244</seg> feeling angry about the fact
            that you have not at all honored the best of the Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[245] Thus spoke [Achilles] the son of Peleus, and he threw the scepter [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">skēptron</foreign>] to the ground, <seg rend="subscript"
            >246</seg> that scepter adorned with golden studs driven into it. Then he sat
            down, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely from his place upon the other side.
            Then up rose smooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words
            fell from his lips sweeter than honey. [250] Two generations of men born and bred in
            sandy Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With
            all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus: </p>
          <p>“Truly,” he said, “a great grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] has
            befallen the Achaean land. [255] Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the
            Trojans be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so
            excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided by
            me. [260] Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men even greater than you are, and
            they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold such men as Perithoös and
            Dryas, shepherd of his people, or as Kaineus, Exadios, godlike Polyphemus, [265] and
            Theseus, son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever born
            upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the fiercest tribes of
            mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went about
            among them, [270] for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a
            man now living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by
            them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent way. [275]
            Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away, for the sons of the
            Achaeans have already given her to Achilles; <seg rend="subscript">277</seg> Don’t you,
            [Achilles] son of Peleus, be quarrelling with the king, <seg rend="subscript"
            >278</seg> force against force, since it is never an equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >homoiē</foreign>] honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>], I mean, the rank
              inherited <seg rend="subscript">279</seg> by a king holding the scepter, to whom Zeus
            has given a luminous sign of sovereignty. [280] Even if you [= Achilles] are as mighty
            as you are, born of a goddess, <seg rend="subscript">281</seg> nevertheless, he [=
            Agamemnon] is superior in status, since he rules over more subjects. Son of Atreus,
            check your anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>], I implore you; end this
            quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle is a tower of strength to the
            Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[285] And Agamemnon answered, “Sir, all that you have said is true, but this man wants
            to become our lord and master: he must be lord of all, king of all, and chief of all,
            and this shall hardly be. [290] Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior,
            have they also given him the right to speak with railing?” </p>
          <p>Achilles interrupted him. “I should be a coward and a good-for-nothing,” he cried, “if
            I were to give in to you in all things. [295] Order other people about, not me, for I
            shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say—and lay my saying to your heart—I shall fight
            neither you nor any man about this girl, for those that take were those also that gave.
            [300] But of all else that is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try,
            that others may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.” </p>
          <p>When they had quarreled thus angrily, [305] they rose, and broke up the assembly at the
            ships of the Achaeans. Achilles, the son of Peleus, went back to his tents and ships
            with Patroklos, the son of Menoitios and his company, while Agamemnon drew a vessel into
            the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen. [310] He escorted fair-cheeked Khrysēis on
            board and sent moreover a hecatomb for the god. And Odysseus went as chief. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">312</seg> Then they went on board and started sailing along the
            watery pathways. But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they
            purified themselves and cast their impurities into the sea. [315] Then they offered
            hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea shore, and the smoke with the
            savor of their sacrifice rose curling up towards the sky. Thus did they busy themselves
            throughout the army of warriors. </p>
          <p>But Agamemnon did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, [320] and called his
            trusty heralds and attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>]
            Talthybios and Eurybates. “Go,” said he, “to the tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take
            fair-cheeked Brisēis by the hand and bring her here; if he will not give her I shall
            come [325] with others and take her—which will press him harder.” </p>
          <p>He ordered this directly and dismissed them, <seg rend="subscript">327</seg> and the
            two went, unwilling, along the shore of the barren sea, till they came to the tents and
            ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and his ships, [330] and
            ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully and reverently before him,
            and never a word did they speak, but he knew them and said, <seg rend="subscript"
              >334</seg>“Hail, heralds, messengers of Zeus and of men! [335] draw near; my quarrel
            is not with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the girl Brisēis. Therefore,
            Patroklos, bring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed
            gods, by mortal men, [340] and by the fierceness of hard-hearted Agamemnon’s anger,
            that if ever there will be <seg rend="subscript">341</seg> a need for me to ward off the
            disgraceful devastation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">loigos</foreign>], they shall seek and
            they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and <seg rend="subscript"
            >343</seg> knows not a thing when it comes to noticing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noeîn</foreign>] both backward and forward in time <seg rend="subscript"
            >344</seg> that the Achaeans be safe as they fight at the ships.”</p>
          <p>[345] Patroklos did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Brisēis from the
            tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them to the ships of the
            Achaeans—and the woman was loath to go. Then Achilles went all alone [350] by the side
            of the hoary sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], weeping and looking out
            upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer to his immortal
            mother, “Mother,” he cried, “you bore me doomed to live but for a little season; surely
            Zeus, who thunders from Olympus, might have given me honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>]. It is not so: he has not honored me. [355] Agamemnon, son of Atreus,
            has done me dishonor, and has robbed me of my prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >geras</foreign>] by force.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was sitting in the depths
            of the sea hard by the Old One, her father. Soon she rose up like gray mist out of the
            waves, [360] sat down before him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and
            said, “My son, why are you weeping? What is it that gives you grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]? Keep it not from me in your mind [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], but tell me, that we may know it together.” </p>
          <p>Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, [365] “You know it; why tell you what you know well
            already? We went to Thebe, the strong city of Eëtion, destroyed it, and brought here the
            spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely
            fair-cheeked Khrysēis as the prize of Agamemnon; [370] but Khrysēs, priest of Apollo,
            came to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great
            ransom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apoina</foreign>]: moreover he bore in his hand the
            scepter of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and beseeched all the Achaeans,
            [375] but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.</p>
          <p>Then the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking
            the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him
            roughly away. [380] So he went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard
            his prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick
            and fast, for the arrows went everywhere among the wide army of the Achaeans. At last a
            seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] [385] in the fullness of his knowledge
            declared to us the oracles of Apollo the Arch-Destroyer, and I myself was first to say
            that we should appease him. <seg rend="subscript">387</seg> Then an anger took hold of
            the son of Atreus, and straightaway he stood up <seg rend="subscript">388</seg> and
            boastfully promised [verb <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apeileō</foreign>] a <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mūthos</foreign>, which now has come to fulfillment [= verb <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">teleō</foreign>, from noun <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >telos</foreign>‘fulfillment’]. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship [390] to
            Khrysē, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from
            my tent the daughter of Brisēs, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself. </p>
          <p>Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if you have ever
            [395] done him service in word or deed, implore the aid of Zeus. Often in my father’s
            house have I heard you glory in the fact that you alone of the immortals saved the son
            of Kronos from ruin, when the others, [400] with Hera, Poseidon, and Pallas Athena would
            have put him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the
            hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aigaion, for he has more force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] even than his father Ouranos; [405] when
            therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the son of Kronos, the other gods were
            afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp his knees,
            and bid him give aid to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of
            their ships, and perish on the sea shore, [410] that they may reap what joy they may of
            their king, and that Agamemnon, wide-ruling son of Atreus, may regret his derangement
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] in offering insult to the best of the
            fighting Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>Thetis wept and answered, “My son, woe is me that I should have borne and nursed you.
            [415] Would indeed that you had lived your span free from all sorrow at your ships, for
            it is all too brief; alas, that you should be at once short of life and long of sorrow
            above your peers: woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; [420] nevertheless I
            will go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Zeus, if he will hear our
            prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For
            Zeus went yesterday to Okeanos, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went
            with him. [425] He will return to Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his
            dwelling paved with bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to
            persuade him.” </p>
          <p>Then she left him, still furious at the loss of the slim-waisted girl [430] that had
            been taken by force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] from him. Meanwhile
            Odysseus reached Khrysē with the hecatomb. When they had come inside the harbor they
            furled the sails and laid them in the ship’s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered
            the mast into its place, [435] and rowed the ship to the place where they would have her
            lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They then got
            out upon the sea shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo the Archer; Khrysēis also left
            the ship, [440] and Odysseus led her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her
            father. “Khrysēs,” said he, “King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child,
            and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the
            god, [445] who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.”</p>
          <p>So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly, and they
            orderly arranged the holy hecatomb around the altar of the god. They washed their hands
            and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, [450] while Khrysēs lifted up
            his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the silver
            bow, that protects Khrysē and holy Killa, and rules Tenedos with your might. Even as you
            heard me before when I prayed, and you pressed hard upon the Achaeans, [455] so hear me
            yet again, and fulfil my desire. <seg rend="subscript">456</seg> Ward off now from the
            Danaans the disgraceful devastation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">loigos</foreign>]!”</p>
          <p>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done praying and
            sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the victims and killed and
            flayed them. [460] They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of
            fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them. <seg rend="subscript">462</seg> And
            the old man burned them [= the thigh bones] over splinters of wood, and bright wine did
              he <seg rend="subscript">463</seg> pour over them, while the young men were getting
            ready for him the five-pronged forks that they were holding in their hands. When the
            thigh-pieces were burned and they had tasted the innards, [465] they cut the rest up
            small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them
            off: then, when they had finished their work [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>]
            and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were
            satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, [470] attendants filled the
            mixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every man his
            drink-offering.</p>
          <p>Thus all day long they worshipped the god with song, hymning him, <seg rend="subscript"
              >473</seg> the young warriors of the Achaeans, singing a beautiful paean, and the god
            took pleasure in his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>] at their voices;
            [475] but when the sun went down and it became dark, they laid themselves down to sleep
            by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
            appeared they again set sail for the army of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind,
            [480] so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the sail bellied
            with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her
            bows as she went. <seg rend="subscript">483</seg> And the ship ran along the waves, on
            its pathway leading to its destination. When they reached the wide-stretching army of
            the Achaeans, [485] they drew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her
            strong props beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships. </p>
          <p>But Achilles, the son of Peleus in the line of Zeus, stayed at his ships and nursed his
            anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>]. [490] He went not to the
            honor-bringing assembly, and ventured not forth to fight, but gnawed at his own heart,
            pining for battle and the war-cry. </p>
          <p>Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus, [495] and Zeus
            led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son had laid upon her, so she
            rose from under the sea and went through the great sky with early morning to Olympus,
            where she found the mighty wide-seeing son of Kronos sitting all alone upon its topmost
            ridges. [500] She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees,
            while with her right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, saying, </p>
          <p>“Father Zeus, Lord of Sky, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the
            immortals, hear my prayer, [505] and do honor to my son, whose life is to be cut short
            so early. But  <seg rend="subscript">506</seg> Agamemnon, king of men, <seg
              rend="subscript">507</seg> has taken away his honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>]; for he got and keeps his prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >geras</foreign>], having himself taken it away. Honor him then yourself, Olympian
            lord of counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans [510] give my son
            his due and load him with riches in compensation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>Zeus sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still kept firm hold of his
            knees, and besought him a second time. “Incline your head,” said she, “and promise me
            surely, [515] or else deny me—for you have nothing to fear—that I may learn how greatly
            you disdain me.” </p>
          <p>Then Zeus was much troubled and answered, “I shall have trouble if you set me
            quarrelling with Hera, for she will provoke me with her taunting speeches; [520] even
            now she is always railing at me before the other gods and accusing me of giving aid to
            the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will
            bring it about as you wish. [525] See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is
            the most solemn act that I can give to any god. I never retract my word, or deceive, or
            fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my head.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">528</seg>So spoke [Zeus] the son of Kronos, and with his eyebrows
            of blue he made a reinforcing [= <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">epi-</foreign>] nod.  <seg
              rend="subscript">529</seg> Ambrosial were the locks that cascaded from the lord’s
            [530] head immortal. And he caused great Olympus to quake.</p>
          <p>When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted—Zeus to his house, while the
            goddess left the splendor of Olympus, and plunged into the depths of the sea. The gods
            rose from their seats, before the coming of their father. Not one of them dared [535] to
            remain sitting, but all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat.
            But Hera, when she saw him, knew that he and the Old One’s daughter, silver-footed
            Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him. [540]
            “Trickster,” she cried, “which of the gods have you been taking into your counsels now?
            You are always settling matters in secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if
            you could help it, one word of your intentions.”</p>
          <p>[545] “Hera,” replied the father of gods and men, “you must not expect to be informed
            of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it hard to understand them. When
            it is proper for you to hear, there is no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but
            when I mean to keep a matter to myself, [550] you must not pry nor ask questions.” </p>
          <p>“Dread son of Kronos,” answered ox-vision Hera, “what are you talking about? I? Pry and
            ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything. [555] Still, I have a
            strong misgiving that the Old Man of the Sea’s daughter, silver-footed Thetis has been
            talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees this self-same
            morning. I believe, therefore, that you have been promising her to give honor to
            Achilles, and to kill many people at the ships of the Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[560] “Wife,” said Zeus, master of cloud and storm, “I can do nothing but you suspect
            me and find it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the more,
            and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to have it so;
            [565] sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin to lay my hands
            about you, though all the gods were on your side it would profit you nothing.” </p>
          <p>Then ox-vision Hera was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat down in
            silence. [570] But the sky-dwellers were disquieted throughout the house of Zeus, till
            the cunning artisan Hephaistos began to try and pacify his beloved mother Hera of the
            white arms. “It will be intolerable,” said he, “if you two fall to wrangling [575] and
            setting the gods in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such ill counsels are to
            prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother—and she
            must herself know that it will be better—to make friends with my dear father Zeus, lest
            he again scold her and disturb our feast. [580] If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl
            us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair
            words, and he will then soon be in a good humor with us.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, [585] and placed it in his mother’s hand.
            “Cheer up, my dear mother,” said he, “and make the best of it. I love you dearly, and
            should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not
            help for there is no standing up against Zeus. [590] Once before when I was trying to
            help you, he caught me by the foot and flung me from the celestial threshold. All day
            long from morning till evening was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the
            island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians
            came and tended me.” </p>
          <p>[595] Ivory-armed Hera smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her
            son’s hands. Then Hephaistos drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served it round
            among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods laughed out a loud
            approval [600] as they saw him bustling about the celestial dwellings. </p>
          <p>Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and all had
            their full share, so that everyone was satisfied. Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses
            lifted up their sweet voices, calling out and making response to one another. [605] But
            when the sun’s glorious light had faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode,
            which lame Hephaistos with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Zeus, the
            Olympian Lord of Thunder, hastened to the bed [610] in which he always slept; and when
            he had got on top of it he went to sleep, with Hera of the golden throne, by his
            side.</p>
        </div>
        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 2</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept
            soundly, but sweet sleep did not take hold of Zeus, for he was thinking how to do honor
            to Achilles, to destroy many people at the ships of the Achaeans. [5] In the end he
            thought it would be best to send a false dream to Atreus’ son King Agamemnon; so he
            called one to him and said to it, “False Dream, go to the ships of the flowing-haired
            Achaeans, [10] into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you.
            Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no
            longer divided counsels among the gods; [15] Hera has brought them to her own mind, and
            woe to the Trojans!”</p>
          <p>The dream went off when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the
            Achaeans. It sought out Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and found him in his tent, wrapped in
            a profound slumber. [20] It hovered over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of
            Neleus, whom Agamemnon honored above all his councilors, and said: </p>
          <p>“You are sleeping, son of Atreus; [25] one who has the welfare of his assembly of
            warriors and so much other care upon his shoulders should limit his sleep. Hear me at
            once, for I come as a messenger from Zeus, who, though he is not near, yet takes thought
            for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall
            take [30] Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Hera has brought
            them over to her own mind, and woe to the Trojans at the hands of Zeus! Remember this,
            and when you wake see that it does not escape you.”</p>
          <p>[35] The dream then left him <seg rend="subscript">36</seg> thinking in his <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign> about things that were not to be: <seg
              rend="subscript">37</seg> for he thought that he would capture Priam’s city on that
            very day, <seg rend="subscript">38</seg> the fool; he did not know what things Zeus was
            planning to do. <seg rend="subscript">39</seg> For he [Zeus] was yet to inflict pains
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">algea</foreign>] and groaning [40] on both Trojans and
            Danaans in battles of power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kratos</foreign>]. Then presently
            he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put
            on his soft khiton so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals
            on to his comely feet, [45] and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then
            he took the imperishable [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aphthiton</foreign>] staff of his
            father, and came forth to the ships of the bronze-armored Achaeans. </p>
          <p>The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might herald day to Zeus
            and to the other immortals, [50] and Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people
            in assembly; so they called them and the people gathered then. But first he summoned a
            meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, [55] and when they were
            assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them. </p>
          <p>“My friends,” said he, “I have had a divine dream in the dead of night, and the dream’s
            face and figure resembled none but Nestor’s. It hovered over my head and said, [60] ‘You
            are sleeping, son of high-spirited Atreus, breaker of horses; one who has the welfare of
            his assembly of warriors and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his
            sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Zeus, who, though he be not near, yet
            takes thought for you and pities you. [65] He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under
            arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Hera
            has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans [70] at the hands of
            Zeus. Remember this.’ The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm
            the sons of the flowing-haired Achaeans. But it will be the right thing [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] that I should first sound them, and to this end I
            will tell them to flee with their ships; [75] but do you others go about among the army
            of warriors and prevent their doing so.” </p>
          <p>He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of sandy Pylos with all sincerity and goodwill
            addressed them thus: “My friends,” said he, “princes and councilors of the Argives, [80]
            if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it
            false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he has seen <seg rend="subscript"
              >82</seg> who boasts to be by far the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >aristos</foreign>] of the Achaeans; we must therefore set about getting the people
            under arms.” </p>
          <p>With this he led the way from the assembly, [85] and the other sceptered kings rose
            with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear.
            They swarmed like bees that come forth from some hollow cave and flit in countless
            throng among the spring flowers, [90] bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the
            mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon
            the wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumor, messenger of Zeus, urging
            them ever to the fore. [95] Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the
            earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heralds
            went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till
            at last they were got into their several places and ceased their clamor. [100] Then
            powerful King Agamemnon rose, holding his scepter. It was the work of Hephaistos, who
            gave it to Zeus the son of Kronos. Zeus gave it to the courier Hermes, slayer of Argos,
            guide and guardian. King Hermes gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and [105]
            Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes,
            rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might
            be lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his scepter, he addressed the
            Argives.</p>
          <p>[110] “My friends,” he said, “heroes, attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, Zeus, the son of Kronos, has tied me down
              with <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>. Cruel, he gave me his solemn promise that
            I should destroy the strong-walled city of Priam before returning, but he has played me
            false, and is now bidding me [115] go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much
            people. Such is the will of strong Zeus, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as
            he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter
            that an [120] Achaean army of warriors, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain
            against men fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think
            that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they have each
            been numbered— [125] the Trojans by the counting of their householders, and we by
            companies of ten; think further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan
            householder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a
            company would have to go without its cup-bearer. [130] But they have in the town allies
            from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being able to destroy the rich
            city of Ilion. Nine of Zeus’ years are gone; [135] the timbers of our ships have rotted;
            their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look anxiously for
            our coming, but the work that we came here to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let
            us all do as I say: [140] let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy
            of the wide ways.” </p>
          <p>With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them as knew not the
            cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and fro like the waves [145] of the Icarian
            Sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], when the east and south winds break
            from celestial clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over a field of
            wheat and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they swayed as they flew with
            loud cries [150] towards the ships, and the dust from under their feet rose skyward.
            They cheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in
            front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the sky rang
            with their glad cries, so eager were they to return.</p>
          <p>[155] Then surely the Argives would have had a return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >nostos</foreign>] after a fashion that was not fated. But Hera said to Athena, “Alas,
            daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, the one who cannot be worn down, shall the Argives flee
            home to their own land over the broad sea, [160] and leave Priam and the Trojans the
            glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the bronze-armored Achaeans have
            died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the army of warriors, and
            speak fairly to them, man by man, [165] that they draw not their ships into the
            sea.” </p>
          <p>Owl-vision goddess Athena was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the
            topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the Achaeans. There
            she found Odysseus, peer of Zeus in counsel, [170] standing alone. He had not as yet
            laid a hand upon his ship, for he felt grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]
            and was sorry; so she went close up to him and said, “Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of
            Laertes, [175] are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your
            own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping
            Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes?
            Go about at once among the army of warriors, [180] and speak fairly to them, man by man,
            that they draw not their ships into the sea.” </p>
          <p>Odysseus knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak from him and set off
            to run. His attendant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the
            cloak, [185] whereon Odysseus went straight up to Agamemnon son of Atreus and received
            from him his ancestral, imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of
            the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke to him fairly. [190]
            “Sir,” said he, “this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand by your post, and bid your
            people also keep their places. You do not yet know the full mind [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and before long will
            visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the council to hear
            what he then said; [195] see to it lest he be angry and do us harm; for the honor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] of kings is great, and the hand of Zeus is
            with them.” </p>
          <p>But when he came across some man from some locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>] who was making a noise, he struck him with his staff and rebuked
            him, saying, [200] “What kind of superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] has possessed you? Hold your peace, and listen to better men than
            yourself. You are a coward and no warrior; you are nobody either in fight or council; we
            cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must be
            supreme— [205] one king to whom the son of scheming Kronos has given the scepter and
            divine laws to rule over you all.” </p>
          <p>Thus masterfully did he go about among the army of warriors, and the people hurried
            back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the thunder of surf when
            it comes crashing down upon the shore, [210] and all the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>] is in an uproar. </p>
          <p>The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, but Thersites still
            went on wagging his unbridled tongue—a man of many words, and those unseemly [=
              without <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>]; a monger of sedition, a railer
            against all who were in authority, rashly but not according to order [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>], [215] so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh.
            He was the ugliest man of all those that came to Troy—bandy-legged, lame of one foot,
            with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point,
            but there was little hair on the top of it. [220] He was hateful to Achilles and
            Odysseus most of all, <seg rend="subscript">221</seg> because he made a quarrel
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">neikos</foreign>] against these two; now, however, with a
            shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on radiant Agamemnon. The Achaeans were
            angry and disgusted, but nevertheless he kept on brawling and bawling at the son of
            Atreus.</p>
          <p>[225] “Agamemnon,” he cried, “what ails you now, and what more do you want? Your tents
            are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever we take a town we give you the
            pick of them. Would you have yet more gold, [230] which some Trojan is to give you as a
            ransom for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some
            young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,
            should bring them into such misery. [235] Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let
            us sail home, and leave this man here at Troy to stew in his own prizes of honor, and
            discover whether or not we were of any service to him. Achilles is a much better man
            than he is, and see how he has treated him— [240] robbing him of his prize and keeping
            it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you
            would never again insult him.” </p>
          <p>Thus railed Thersites, but radiant Odysseus at once went up to him [245] and rebuked
            him sternly. “Check your glib tongue, Thersites,” said be, “and babble not a word
            further. Chide not princes when you have no one to back you. There is no viler creature
            that has come to Troy with the sons of Atreus. [250] Drop this chatter about kings, and
            neither revile them nor keep harping about homecoming [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >nostos</foreign>]. We do not yet know how things are going to be, nor whether the
            Achaeans are to return with good success or evil. How dare you berate Agamemnon, son of
            Atreus, shepherd of the people, [255] because the Danaans have awarded him so many
            prizes? I tell you, therefore—and it shall surely be—that if I again catch you talking
            such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head [260] and be no longer called father of
            Telemachus, or I will take you, strip you stark naked to reveal your shame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>], and whip you out of the assembly till you go
            blubbering back to the ships.”</p>
          <p>[265] Then he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till he dropped and
            fell weeping. The golden scepter raised a bloody welt on his back, so he sat down
            frightened and in pain, looking foolish as he wiped the tears from his eyes. [270] The
            people were sorry for him, but they laughed heartily, and one man would turn to his
            neighbor saying, “Odysseus has done many a good thing before now in fight and council,
            but he never did the Argives a better turn [275] than when he stopped this man’s mouth
            from barking any further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.” </p>
          <p>Thus said the people. Then Odysseus, ransacker of cities, rose, scepter in hand, and
            owl-vision Athena [280] in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those
            who were far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with all
            sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: </p>
          <p>“King Agamemnon, son of Atreus, the Achaeans are for [285] making you a by-word among
            all humankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from
            horse-pasturing Argos, that you should not return till you had destroyed the town of
            strong-walled Troy, and, like children or widowed women, [290] they murmur and would set
            off homeward. True it is that they have had toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] enough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from
            his wife even for a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea,
            [295] but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,
            blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home
            empty-handed after so long a stay— <seg rend="subscript">299</seg> Endure, my near and
            dear ones [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philoi</foreign>], and stay as long as it takes for
            us to find out [300] whether Kalkhas is prophesying something that is true or not. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">301</seg> For I know this well in my heart, and you all <seg
              rend="subscript">302</seg> are witnesses, those of you who have not been carried off
            by the demons of death.  <seg rend="subscript">303</seg> It is as if it was yesterday or
            the day before, when the ships of the Achaeans at Aulis <seg rend="subscript"
            >304</seg> were gathered, portending doom to Priam and the Trojans. [305] Standing
            around a spring, at a sacred altar, <seg rend="subscript">306</seg> we were sacrificing
            perfect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telēessai</foreign>] hecatombs to the immortal
              ones <seg rend="subscript">307</seg> under a beautiful plane tree, in a place where
            sparkling water flowed. <seg rend="subscript">308</seg> Then there appeared [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">phainesthai</foreign>] a great sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign>], a serpent [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">drakōn</foreign>] with blood-red
            markings on its back. <seg rend="subscript">309</seg> Terrifying it was. The Olympian [=
            Zeus] himself had sent it into the zone of light. [310] It darted out from underneath
            the altar, and it rushed toward the plane tree. <seg rend="subscript">311</seg> Over
            there were the nestlings of a sparrow, helpless young things. <seg rend="subscript"
              >312</seg> In the highest branch amidst the leaves they were hiding in fear, <seg
              rend="subscript">313</seg> eight of them. The ninth was the mother that had hatched
            the young ones. <seg rend="subscript">314</seg> Then it devoured them, in a way that is
            pitiful [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">eleeina</foreign>], while they were chirping. [315]
            And their mother was fluttering above, lamenting [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >oduresthai</foreign>] for her dear little things. <seg rend="subscript"
            >316</seg> Then it threw its coils around her, catching her by the wing as she was
            wailing over [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">amphiakhuia</foreign>] them. <seg
              rend="subscript">317</seg> And when it devoured the young ones of the sparrow and the
            mother as well, <seg rend="subscript">318</seg> the same god that had made it visible
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phainein</foreign>] now made it most visible [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">arizēlos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">319</seg> For the son of
            crafty Kronos now made it into stone. [320] We just stood there, struck with awe
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thauma</foreign>] at what happened, <seg rend="subscript"
              >321</seg> how such frightful portents invaded the hecatombs of the gods. <seg
              rend="subscript">322</seg> Then, right away, Kalkhas spoke, speaking the words of
            seers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theopropeîn</foreign>]: <seg rend="subscript"
            >323</seg> “Why are you speechless, Achaeans with the elaborate hair? <seg
              rend="subscript">324</seg> Zeus, master of craft, made visible [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">phainein</foreign>] this great portent [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >teras</foreign>]. [325] It is late in coming, late in reaching its outcome [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>], and its fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>] will never perish. <seg rend="subscript">326</seg> Just as this
            thing devoured the young ones of the sparrow and the mother as well, <seg
              rend="subscript">327</seg> eight in number, while the mother made it nine, the one
            that hatched the young ones, <seg rend="subscript">328</seg> so also we will wage war
            for that many years in number, <seg rend="subscript">329</seg> and then, on the tenth
            year, we will capture the city with its broad streets.” [330] Thus spoke that man. And
            now I see that all these things are reaching their outcome [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">331</seg> So come now, all of you, hold your
            place, all you Achaeans with the fine shin-guards, <seg rend="subscript">332</seg> stay
            here until we capture the great city of Priam.” </p>
          <p>Then the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the uproar. [335]
            Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, then addressed them. “Shame on you,” he cried, “to stay
            talking here like children, when you should fight like men. Where are our covenants now,
            and where the oaths that we have taken? [340] Shall our counsels be flung into the fire,
            with our drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our
            trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking here shall be no further
            forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; [345] lead the
            Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in
            vain, to get back to Argos before they have learned whether Zeus be true or a liar.
            [350] For the mighty son of all-powerful Kronos surely promised that we should succeed,
            when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He showed us
            favorable signs [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēmata</foreign>] by flashing his lightning on
            our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go [355] till he has first lain with
            the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the
            sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him
            lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. [360] But, O
            king, consider and listen to my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected
            lightly. Divide [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] your men, Agamemnon, into
            their several tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help one another.
            If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, [365] you will find out who, both chiefs
            and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus
            you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of the gods or the cowardice of
            men that you shall fail to take the town.” </p>
          <p>And powerful Agamemnon answered, [370] “Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of the
            Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I had among them
            ten more such councilors, for the city of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our
            hands, and we should destroy it. [375] But Zeus of the aegis the son of Kronos afflicts
            me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl,
            in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mind again, [380] the
            Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal,
            that our armies of warriors join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the
            ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your swift-footed horses, and look your
            chariots carefully over, [385] that we may do battle the livelong day. <seg
              rend="subscript">386</seg> There will not be a pause for rest [from battle] in
            between, not a bit, <seg rend="subscript">387</seg> unless the night comes and separates
            the ménos from the men. The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat
            upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, [390] your horses shall
            steam in front of your chariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to
            keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to
            dogs and vultures.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared approval. As when the waves run high [395]
            before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty headland, dashing against it
            and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so
            did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted
            their fires at their tents and got dinner, [400] offering sacrifice every man to one or
            other of the gods, and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the
            fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of
            Kronos, and invited the princes and elders of his assembly of warriors. [405] First he
            asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly
            Odysseus, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaos came of his own accord, for he knew how
            busy his brother then was. [410] They stood round the bull with the barley-meal in their
            hands, and powerful Agamemnon prayed, saying, “Zeus, most glorious, supreme, that dwells
            in the sky, and rides upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the
            night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, [415] and its gates are consumed with
            fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the khiton of Hector about his heart, and that full
            many of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.” </p>
          <p>Thus he prayed, but the son of Kronos would not fulfill his prayer. [420] He accepted
            the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the
            barley-meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it.
            They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of
            raw meat on the top of them. [425] These they burned upon the split logs of firewood,
            but they spitted the innards, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-pieces
            were burned, and they had tasted the innards, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces
            upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off; [430] then, when they
            had finished their work [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and the feast was
            ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As
            soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, began to
            speak. “King Agamemnon,” said he, [435] “let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in
            the work that the gods have put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the
            bronze-armored people to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among the
            army of warriors, [440] that we may begin fighting at once.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and the lord of men Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent the
            criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and the people
            gathered then. [445] The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their men and marshaled
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] them, while owl-vision Athena went among
            them holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there waved a
            hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred
            oxen. [450] With this she darted furiously everywhere among the masses of the Achaeans,
            urging them forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight
            and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than returning
            home in their ships. [455] As when some great forest fire is raging upon a mountain top
            and its light is seen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armor flashed up
            into the firmament of the sky. </p>
          <p>They were like great flocks [460] of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain about the
            waters of Cayster, that wing their way here and there, glorying in the pride of flight,
            and crying as they settle till the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did
            their tribes pour from ships and tents [465] on to the plain of the Skamandros, and the
            ground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the
            flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in season [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hōrā</foreign>]. </p>
          <p>As countless swarms of flies [470] buzz around a herdsman’s homestead in the time
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] of spring when milk is splashing in the
            pails, even so did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy
            them. </p>
          <p>The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began, drafting them
            out [475] as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they have got mixed while
            feeding; and among them went powerful King Agamemnon, with a head and face like Zeus the
            lord of thunder, a waist like Arēs, and a chest like that of Poseidon. [480] As some
            great bull that lords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Zeus make the son of
            Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">484</seg> And now, tell me, O Muses, you who live in your

          <p>Peneleos, Leitos, [495] Arkesilaos, Prothoenor, and Klonios were chiefs of the
            Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Skhoinos,
            Skolos, and the highlands of Eteonos, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of
            Mykalessos. They also held Harma, Eilesion, and Erythrai; [500] and they had Eleon,
            Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe,
            the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartos; Plataea and Glisas; [505]
            the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onkhestos with its famous grove of Poseidon; Arne,
            rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came
            fifty ships, and in each [510] there were a hundred and twenty young men of the
            Boeotians.</p>
          <p>Askalaphos and Ialmenos, sons of Arēs, led the people that dwelt in Aspledon and
            Orkhomenos the realm of Minyas. Astyokhe a noble maiden bore them in the house of Aktor
            son of Azeus; for she had gone with Arēs secretly into an upper chamber, [515] and he
            had lain with her. With these there came thirty ships. </p>
          <p>The Phocians were led by Skhedios and Epistrophos, sons of mighty Iphitos, the son of
            great-hearted Naubolos. These were they that held Kyparissos, rocky Pytho [Delphi],
            [520] holy Krisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea and Hyampolis,
            and about the waters of the river Kephissos, and Lilaea by the springs of the Kephissos;
            with their chieftains came forty ships, [525] and they marshaled the forces of the
            Phocians, which were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left. </p>
          <p>Ajax, the fleet son of Oïleus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so great, nor nearly
            so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little man, and his breastplate was made
            of linen, [530] but in use of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans.
            These dwelt in Kynos, Opous, Kalliaros, Bessa, Skarphe, fair Augeiai, Tarphe, and
            Thronion about the river Boagrios. With him there came forty ships [535] of the Locrians
            who dwell beyond sacred Euboea. </p>
          <p>The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Khalkis, Eretria, Histiaia, rich in
            vines, Kerinthos upon the sea, and the rock-perched town of Dion; with them were also
            the men of Karystos and Styra; [540] Elephenor of the lineage of Arēs was in command of
            these; he was son of Khalkodon, and chief over all the great-hearted Abantes. With him
            they came, fleet of foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would
            ever strive to tear open the armor of their foes with their long ashen spears. [545] Of

              rend="subscript">552</seg> And their leader was Menestheus, son of Peteoos. <seg
              rend="subscript">553</seg> Never before had there been a mortal man who was equal to
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">homoios</foreign>] him [= Menestheus] <seg rend="subscript"
              >554</seg> in marshaling [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmeîn</foreign>] the horse-drawn
            chariot teams and the shield-bearing warriors. [555] Nestor could alone rival him, for
            he was older. With him there came fifty ships. </p>
          <p>Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside those of the
            Athenians. </p>
          <p>The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, [560] with Hermione,
            and Asine upon the gulf; Trozen, Eionai, and the vineyard lands of Epidauros; the
            Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomedes of
            the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelos son of famed Kapaneus. [565] With them in command was
            Euryalos, a godlike man, son of king Mekisteus, son of Talaos; but Diomedes of the great
            war cry was chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships. </p>
          <p>Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, [570] rich Corinth and Kleonai; Orneai,
            lovely Araithyrea, and Likyon, where Adrastos reigned of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa,
            and Pellene; Aigion [575] and all the coast-land round about Helike; these sent a
            hundred ships under the command of powerful King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was
            far both finest and most numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious
            in his armor of gleaming bronze—foremost among the heroes, [580] because he was the best
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aristos</foreign>], and he led the most numerous host. </p>
          <p>And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis, Sparta, with
            Messe, the haunt of doves; Bryseai, lovely Augeiai, Amyklai, and Helos upon the sea;
            [585] Laas, moreover, and Oitylos; these were led by Menelaos of the loud battle-cry,
            brother to Agamemnon, and of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the
            others. Among them went Menelaos himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for
            he longed to [590] avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of
            Helen. </p>
          <p>The men of Pylos and lovely Arene, and Thryon where is the ford of the river Alpheus;
            strong-built Aepy, Kyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleon, Helos, and Dorion, where the
            Muses [595] met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for ever. He was returning from
            Oikhalia, where Eurytos lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the
            Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus, if they should sing against him; whereon they
            were angry, and maimed him. [600] They robbed him of his divine power of song, and
            thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, charioteer
            of Gerenia, and with him there came ninety ships. </p>
          <p>And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near the tomb of
            Aipytos, where the people fight hand to hand; [605] the men of Pheneus also, and
            Orkhomenos rich in flocks; of Rhipai, Stratie, and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair
            Mantinea; of Stymphelos and Parrhasia; of these powerful King Agapenor, son of Ankaios,
            was commander, [610] and they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good warriors, came in
            each one of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], for they were not a people that occupied their
            business upon the waters.</p>
          <p>[615] The men, moreover, of Bouprasion and of radiant Elis, so much of it as is
            enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinos upon the sea shore, the rock Olene and Alesion. These
            had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many Epeioi on board. [620] Their
            chiefs were Amphimakhos and Thalpios—the one, son of Kteatos, and the other, of
            Eurytos—both of the lineage of Aktor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynkes, and
            godlike Polyxenos, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.</p>
          <p>[625] And those of Doulikhion with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt beyond the
            sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Arēs, and the son of valiant Phyleus,
            dear to Zeus, who quarreled with his father, and went to settle in Doulikhion. [630]
            With him there came forty ships. </p>
          <p>Odysseus led the brave Kephallēnians, who held Ithaca, Neriton with its forests,
            Crocyleia, rugged Aigilips, Samos and Zakynthos, [635] with the mainland also that was
            over against the islands. These were led by Odysseus, peer of Zeus in counsel, and with
            him there came twelve ships. </p>
          <p>Thoas, son of Andraimon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron, Olenos, Pylene,
            [640] Khalkis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great high-hearted king Oineus had
            now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also golden-haired Meleagros, who had
            been set over the Aetolians to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.</p>
          <p>[645] The famous spearman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Knossos, and the
            well-walled city of Gortys; Lyktos also, Miletus and silver-shining Lykastos that lies
            upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaistos and Rhytion, with the other peoples that
            dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. [650] All these were led by Idomeneus, and by
            Meriones, peer of manslaughtering Arēs. And with these there came eighty ships.</p>
          <p>Tlepolemos, son of Hēraklēs, a man both brave and large of stature, brought nine ships
            of lordly warriors from Rhodes. [655] These dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the
            three cities of Lindos, Ialysos, and Kameiros, that lies upon the chalk. These were
            commanded by Tlepolemos, son of mighty Hēraklēs and born of Astyochea, whom he had
            carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, [660] after destroying many cities of
            valiant warriors. When Tlepolemos grew up, he killed his father’s uncle Likymnios, scion
            of Arēs, who had been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. Then he
            built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, [665] and fled beyond the sea
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], for he was menaced by the other sons and
            grandsons of Hēraklēs. After a voyage during which he suffered great hardship, he came
            as a wanderer to Rhodes, where the people divided into three communities, according to
            their tribes, and were dearly loved by Zeus, the lord of gods and men; [670] wherefore
            the son of Kronos who is lord over all gods and all men, showered down great riches upon
            them. </p>
          <p>And Nireus brought three ships from Syme —Nireus, who was the handsomest man that came
            up under Ilion of all the Danaans after the perfect son of Peleus— [675] but he was a
            man of no substance, and had but a small following.</p>
          <p>And those that held Nisyros, Karpathos, and Kasos, with Kos, the city of Eurypylos, and
            the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippos and Antiphos, two sons of King
            Thessalos the son of Hēraklēs. [680] And with them there came thirty ships. </p>
          <p>Those again who held Pelasgian Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and those of Phthia and
            Hellas the land of fair women, who were called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; [685]
            these had fifty ships, over which Achilles was in command. But they now took no part in
            the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for swift-footed radiant Achilles
            stayed by his ships, furious about the loss of the girl of the lovely hair, Brisēis,
            whom he had taken from Lyrnessos at his own great peril, [690] when he had destroyed
            Lyrnessos and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes, the furious spearman, and Epistrophos,
            sons of king Euenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still in grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>], but before long he was again to join them.</p>
          <p>[695] And then there were those that held Phylake and Pyrasos, with its flowery
              meadows, <seg rend="subscript">696</seg> precinct of Demeter; and Iton, the mother of
              sheep; <seg rend="subscript">697</seg> Antron upon the sea, and Pteleon that lies upon
            the grass lands. <seg rend="subscript">698</seg> Of these men the Arēs-like Protesilaos
            had been leader <seg rend="subscript">699</seg> while he was still alive, but now he was
            held down by the black earth that covered him. [700] He had left a wife behind him in
            Phylake to tear both her cheeks in sorrow, <seg rend="subscript">701</seg> and his house
            was only half completed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hēmi-telēs</foreign>]. He was killed
            by a Dardanian warrior <seg rend="subscript">702</seg> while he was leaping out from his
            ship [on Trojan soil], and he was the very first of the Achaeans to make the leap. <seg
              rend="subscript">703</seg> Still, his people were not without a leader, though they
            longed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">potheîn</foreign>] for their leader. <seg
              rend="subscript">704</seg> But now his people were organized [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kosmeîn</foreign>] by Podarkes, attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ozos</foreign>]
            of Arēs. [705] He [= Podarkes] was son of Iphiklos, rich in sheep, who was the son of
              Phylakos, <seg rend="subscript">706</seg> and he [= Podarkes] was the blood brother of
            Protesilaos, the one with the great heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">707</seg> But he [= Podarkes] was younger,
            Protesilaos being both older and more Arēs-like, <seg rend="subscript">708</seg> yes,
            that hero [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hērōs</foreign>] Protesilaos, the Arēs-like. Still,
            his people were not <seg rend="subscript">709</seg> without a leader, though they longed
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">potheîn</foreign>] for him [= Protesilaos], noble [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">esthlos</foreign>] man that he was. [710] With him there came forty
            ships. </p>
          <p>And those that held Pherai by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrai, and the
            strong-founded populous city of Iolkos, these with their eleven ships were led by
            Eumelos, dear son of Admetos, [715] whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the
            daughters of Pelias. And those that held Methone and Thaumakia, with Meliboia and rugged
            Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they had seven ships, each
            with fifty oarsmen [720] all of them good archers; but Philoctetes was lying in great
            pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been
            bitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and in grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>], [725] and full soon did the Argives come to miss
            him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the
            bastard son of Oïleus by Rhene, set them in array. </p>
          <p>Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, [730] and they that held
            Oikhalia, the city of Oikhalian Eurytos, these were commanded by the two sons of
            Asklepios, skilled in the art of healing, Podaleirios and Makhaon. And with them there
            came thirty ships. The men, moreover, of Ormenios, and by the fountain of Hypereia,
            [735] with those that held Asterios, and the white crests of Titanos, these were led by
            Eurypylos, the shining son of Euaimon, and with them there came forty ships. </p>
          <p>Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city of Oloösson,
            [740] of these brave Polypoites, stubborn in battle, was leader. He was son of
            Perithoös, who was son of Zeus himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Perithoös on the day
            when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages and drove them from Mount Pelion
            to the Aithikes. [745] But Polypoites was not sole in command, for with him was
            Leonteus, of the lineage of Arēs, who was son of high-hearted Koronos, the son of
            Kaineus. And with these there came forty ships. </p>
          <p>Gouneus brought two and twenty ships from Kyphos, and he was followed by the Enienes
            and the valiant Perrhaiboi, [750] who dwelt about wintry Dodona, and held the lands
            round the lovely river Titaresios, which sends its waters into the Peneus. They do not
            mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; [755]
            for the Titaresios is a branch of dread Orkos and of the river Styx, the fearful
            oath-river. </p>
          <p>Of the Magnetes, Prothoös son of Tenthredon was commander. They were they that dwelt
            about the river Peneus and Mount Pelion. Prothoös, fleet of foot, was their leader, and
            with him there came forty ships. </p>
          <p>[760] So now, these were the leaders of the Danaans and their lords. <seg
              rend="subscript">761</seg> Who, then, was by far the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aristos</foreign>] —tell me, Muse! —of men or horses, among those that followed after
            the sons of Atreus? </p>
          <p>Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest. They were driven by
            Eumelos, and were as fleet as birds. [765] They were of the same age and color, and
            perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea—both of
            them mares, and terrifying as Arēs in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, <seg
              rend="subscript">769</seg> so long as Achilles was angry; for he was by far the best
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phertatos</foreign>], for Achilles the blameless son of
            Peleus excelled him greatly [770] and he had also better horses; but Achilles was now
            holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, shepherd of the
            people, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming
            with spears at a mark, [775] and in archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot,
            champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners,
            for lack of leadership, wandered here and there about the army of warriors and went not
            forth to fight.</p>
          <p>[780] Thus marched the army like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned beneath them
            when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land about Typhoeus among the Arimoi,
            where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so did the earth groan beneath them [785] as they
            sped over the plain. </p>
          <p>And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Zeus of the aegis to tell the bad news
            among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young, at Priam’s gates,
            [790] and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice of Priam’s son Polites,
            who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old
            Aisyetes, to look out for any attack of the Achaeans. [795] In his likeness Iris the
            swift-running spoke, saying, “Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is
            at hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such an army of warriors as is
            now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as [800] thick as leaves
            or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say. There
            are many allies dispersed about the city of Priam from distant places and speaking
            divers tongues. [805] Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, setting
            them severally in array and leading them forth to battle.” </p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once broke up the
            assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened, and the people thronged
            through them, [810] horse and foot, with the tramp as of a great multitude. </p>
          <p>Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the plain. Men call it
            Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>]
            of lithe dancing Myrrhine. [815] Here the Trojans and their allies divided their
            forces. </p>
          <p>Priam’s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans, and with him
            were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant of those who were longing for
            the fray. </p>
          <p>The Dardanians were led by brave [820] Aeneas, whom divine Aphrodite bore to Anchises,
            when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain slopes of Ida. He
            was not alone, for with him were the two sons of Antenor, Arkhilokhos and Akamas, both
            skilled in all the arts of war. </p>
          <p>They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mount Ida, [825] men of substance,
            who drink the limpid waters of the Aisepos, and are of Trojan blood—these were led by
            Pandaros shining son of Lykaon, whom Apollo had taught to use the bow. </p>
          <p>They that held Adrasteia and the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
            Apaisos, with Pityeia, and the high mountain of Tereia— [830] these were led by Adrastos
            and Amphios, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Perkote,
            who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part in the war, but
            they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to destruction.</p>
          <p>[835] They that dwelt about Perkote and Praktios, with Sestos, Abydos, and radiant
            Arisbe—these were led by Asios, son of Hyrtakos, a brave commander— Asios, the son of
            Hyrtakos, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of the breed that comes from the river
            Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.</p>
          <p>[840] Hippothoös led the tribes of Pelasgian spearmen, who dwelt in fertile
            Larissa—Hippothoös, and Pylaios of the lineage of Arēs, two sons of the Pelasgian
            Lethos, son of Teutamos. Akamas and the warrior Peiroös commanded the Thracians [845]
            and those that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont. </p>
          <p>Euphemos, son of Troizenos, the son of Keos, was chief of the spear-carrying Kikones.
            Pyraikhmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad waters of the
            river Axios, [850] the fairest that flow upon the earth. </p>
          <p>The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaimenes from Enetai, where the
            mules run wild in herds. These were they that held Kytoros and the country round
            Sesamos, with the cities by the river Parthenios, [855] Kromna, Aigialos, and lofty
            Erythinoi. </p>
          <p>Odios and Epistrophos were chiefs over the Halizonoi from distant Alybe, where there
            are mines of silver. Khromis, and Ennomos the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in
            augury availed not to save him from destruction, [860] for he fell by the hand of the
            fleet descendant of Aiakos in the river, where he slew others also of the Trojans. </p>
          <p>Phorkys, again, and noble godlike Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far country of
            Ascania, and both were eager for the fray. </p>
          <p>Mesthles and Antiphos commanded the Maeonians, [865] sons of Talaimenes, born to him of
            the Gygaean lake. These led the Maeonians, who dwelt under Mount Tmolos. </p>
          <p>Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus and the wooded
            mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mount
            Mykale. [870] These were commanded by Nastes and Amphimakhos, the brave sons of Nomion.
            He came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was
            of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant of
            Aiakos, [875] and Achilles bore away his gold. </p>
          <p>Sarpedon and Glaukos led the Lycians from their distant land, by the eddying waters of
            the Xanthos.</p>

          <p rend="no-indent">[1] When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own chief,
            the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream overhead when rain
            and winter [5] drive them over the flowing waters of Okeanos to bring death and
            destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans
            marched silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.</p>
          <p>[10] As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain tops, bad for
            shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man can see no further than he can
            throw a stone, even so rose the dust from under their feet as they made all speed over
            the plain.</p>
          <p>[15] When they were close up with one another, Alexandros<ptr type="footnote"
              xml:id="noteref_n.1" target="n.1"/> the godlike came forward as champion on the Trojan
            side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he
            brandished two spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to
            meet him in single fight. [20] Menelaos the warlike saw him stride out thus before the
            ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcass of some goat or horned
            stag, [25] and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. In this
            way was Menelaos glad when his eyes caught sight of godlike Alexandros, thinking now
            that he should take his revenge, and so he sprang from his chariot, clad in his suit of
            armor. </p>
          <p>[30] Alexandros the godlike quailed as he saw Menelaos come forward, and shrank in fear
            of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted, trembling and
            pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain glade, [35] even so did
            godlike Alexandros plunge into the throng of haughty Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at
            the sight of the son of Atreus. </p>
          <p>Then Hector upbraided him. “Paris,”<ptr type="footnote" xml:id="noteref_n.2"
              target="n.2"/><seg rend="superscript"> </seg>said he, “evil-hearted Paris, fair to
            see, but woman-crazed, and false of tongue, [40] would that you had never been born, or
            that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and looked at askance.
            Will not the flowing-haired Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to
            champion us who is fair to look at [45] but has neither might [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >biē</foreign>] in his heart nor any strength? Even so, did you not gather together
            oarsmen as your companions and set sail on the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>]? Did you not carry off a lovely woman from a far country, already
            wedded among a people of warriors— [50] to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and
            your whole locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], but joy to your enemies,
            and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face warlike Menelaos
            and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be
            your lyre and your love-tricks, [55] your comely locks and your fair favor, when you
            were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed people, or before this
            you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs you have done them.” </p>
          <p>And Alexandros the godlike answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just. [60] You are hard as
            the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber to his liking. As
            the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>]. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Aphrodite has given
            me; [65] they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give them where
            they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle
            with Menelaos the warlike, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, [70] while he
            and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious
            and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home,
            but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here
            in Troy, while the others go home [75] to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan ranks holding his
            spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all sat down at his bidding: [80] but
            the flowing-haired Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon
            shouted to them saying, “Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires
            to speak.” </p>
          <p>[85] They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. “Hear from my mouth,”
            said he, “Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans, the saying of Alexandros, through whom
            this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armor upon the
            ground, [90] while he and warlike Menelaos fight in the midst of you for Helen and all
            her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the
            woman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn
            covenant of peace.”</p>
          <p>[95] Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaos of the loud battle-cry
            addressed them. “And now,” he said, “hear me too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved.
            I deem that the parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing
            how much you have suffered [100] for my quarrel with Alexandros and the wrong he did me.
            Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a
            white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Zeus. [105]
            Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his
            sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Zeus must not be transgressed or
            taken in vain. Young men’s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks
            before [110] and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides.”</p>
          <p>The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they thought that they
            should now have rest. They backed their chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and
            put off their armor, laying it down upon the ground; [115] and the armies were near to
            one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to
            bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while powerful Agamemnon told Talthybios to fetch
            the other lamb from the ships, [120] and he did as Agamemnon had said. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile Iris went to Helen of the white arms in the form of her sister-in-law, wife
            of the son of Antenor, for strong Helikaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodike, the
            fairest of Priam’s daughters. [125] She [= Iris] found her [= Helen] in the palace. She
            was weaving a great web,  <seg rend="subscript">126</seg>a purple [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">porphureē</foreign>] fabric that folds in two [= <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">diplax</foreign>], and she was inworking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >en-passein</foreign>] many ordeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">athloi</foreign>]  <seg
              rend="subscript">127</seg>of Trojans, tamers of horses, and of Achaeans, wearers of
            bronze khitons, <seg rend="subscript">128</seg>—ordeals that they suffered at the hands
            of Arēs all because of her. Iris then came close up to her and said, [130] “Come here,
            child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and bronze-armored Achaeans. Till now
            they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they have left
            off fighting, [135] and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears
            planted beside them. Alexandros and Menelaos the warlike are going to fight about
            yourself, and you are to the wife of him who is the victor.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen’s heart yearned [140] after her former husband, her
            city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her head, and hurried from her
            room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, Aithra,
            daughter of Pittheus, and ox-vision Klymene. [145] And straightway they were at the
            Scaean gates. </p>
          <p>The two sages, Oukalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated by the Scaean
            gates, with Priam, Panthoös, Thymoetes, Lampos, Klytios, and Hiketaon, of the lineage of
            Arēs. [150] These were too old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the
            tower like cicadas that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.
            When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, [155] they said softly to one another,
            “There is no way to wish for retribution [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nemesis</foreign>]
            that Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake
            of a woman so marvelously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take
            her and go, [160] or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us.” </p>
          <p>But Priam bade her draw near. “My child,” said he, “take your seat in front of me that
            you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your friends. I lay no blame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aitiā</foreign>] upon you, it is the gods, not you who are responsible
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitioi</foreign>]. [165] It is they that have brought about
            this terrifying war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great
            and goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely [170] and so royal.
            Surely he must be a king.” </p>
          <p>“Sir,” answered Helen, shining among women, “father of my husband, dear and reverend in
            my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here with your son, far
            from my bridal chamber, my friends, [175] my darling daughter, and all the companions of
            my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your
            question, the hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, widely powerful son of Atreus, a good
            king and a brave warrior, [180] brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my
            abhorred and miserable self.” </p>
          <p>The old man marveled at him and said, “Happy son of Atreus, child of good fortune. I
            see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great multitudes. [185] When I was in
            Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of godlike Mygdon, who were
            camping upon the banks of the river Sangarios; I was their ally, and with them when the
            Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, [190] but even they were not so many as the
            glancing-eyed Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>The old man next looked upon Odysseus; “Tell me,” he said, “who is that other, shorter
            by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the chest and shoulders? [195] His armor is
            laid upon the ground, and he stalks in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly
            ram ordering his ewes.” </p>
          <p>And Helen answered, [200] “He is resourceful Odysseus, a man of great craft, son of
            Laertes. He was born in the rugged locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
            Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems and subtle cunning.” </p>
          <p>Then Antenor said, “Madam, you have spoken truly. [205] Radiant Odysseus once came here
            as envoy about yourself, and warlike Menelaos with him. I received them in my own house,
            and therefore know both of them by sight and conversation. When they stood up in the
            presence of the assembled Trojans, [210] Menelaos was the broader shouldered, but when
            both were seated Odysseus had the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their
            message, and the speech of Menelaos ran smoothly on the tongue; he did not say much, for
            he was a man of few words, [215] but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though he
            was the younger man of the two; resourceful Odysseus, on the other hand, when he rose to
            speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play
            nor graceful movement of his scepter; he kept it straight and stiff like a man
            unpracticed in oratory— [220] one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton;
            but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep chest like winter
            snow before the wind, then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of
            what he looked like.” </p>
          <p>[225] Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, “Who is that great and goodly warrior
            whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the Argives?” </p>
          <p>“That,” answered Helen, “is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, [230] and on the other
            side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus, looking like a god, and with the
            chiefs of the Cretans round him. Often did Menelaos receive him as a guest in our house
            when he came visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, [235] many other glancing-eyed
            Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor
            [Kastor], breaker of horses, and Pollux [Polydeukes], the mighty boxer; they are
            children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon,
            [240] or else, though they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in
            battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them.” </p>
          <p>She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth in their own
            land of Lacedaemon.</p>
          <p>[245] Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through the city—two
            lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaios brought the mixing bowl and
            the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and said, [250] “Son of Laomedon, the princes of
            the Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armored Achaeans bid you come down on to the
            plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandros and warlike Menelaos are to fight for
            Helen in single combat, [255] that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the
            victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here
            in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers [260] yoke the horses, and
            they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot, gathered the reins in his hand,
            and Antenor took his seat beside him; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the
            plain. When they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans [265] they left the
            chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between the armies of
            warriors. </p>
          <p>Agamemnon, lord of men, and resourceful Odysseus both rose to meet them. The attendants
            brought on the oath-offerings and [270] mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured
            water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the dagger that hung
            by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs’ heads; this the men-servants gave about among
            the Trojan and Achaean princes, [275] and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in
              prayer. <seg rend="subscript">276</seg> “O Father Zeus, ruler of Ida, most renowned
            and greatest, <seg rend="subscript">276</seg> and O Helios (Sun), who oversees and hears
            all, Earth and Rivers, and you who in the realms below chastise the spirit of him that
            has broken his oath, [280] witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain. If
            Alexandros kills Menelaos, let him keep Helen and all her wealth, while we sail home
            with our ships; but if fair-haired Menelaos kills Alexandros, [285] let the Trojans give
            back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover pay such penalty [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony
            among those that shall be born hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse such penalty
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] when Alexandros has fallen, [290] then will
            I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and laid them down
            gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had robbed them of their strength.
            [295] Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the
            everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, “Zeus, most great and
            glorious, and you other everlasting gods, [300] grant that the brains of them who shall
            first sin against their oaths—of them and their children—may be shed upon the ground
            even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.” </p>
          <p>Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Zeus, son of Kronos, grant them their prayer.
            Then Priam, descendant of Dardanos, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans and you
            strong-greaved Achaeans, [305] I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilion: I
            dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and warlike Menelaos, for
            Zeus and the other immortals alone know which shall fall [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>[310] Then he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He gathered the
            reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two then went back to Ilion. Hector,
            son of Priam, and radiant Odysseus [315] measured the ground, and cast lots from a
            helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile the two armies of
            warriors lifted up their hands and prayed saying, [320] “Father Zeus, that rules from
            Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between us
            may die, and enter the house of Hādēs, while we others remain at peace and abide by our
            oaths.” </p>
          <p>Great Hector of the shining helmet now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,
            [325] and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several stations, each
            by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while radiant Alexandros, husband
            of lovely-haired Helen, put on his goodly armor. [330] First he covered his legs with
            greaves of good make and fitted with ankle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the
            cuirass of his brother Lykaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded
            sword [335] of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely
            head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly
            above it, and he grasped a terrifying spear that suited his hands. In like fashion
            warlike Menelaos also put on his armor. </p>
          <p>[340] When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce of aspect
            into the open space, and both Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaeans
            were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the measured
            ground, [345] brandishing their spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandros
            aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not
            pierce it, for the shield turned its point. [350] Menelaos next took aim, praying to
            Father Zeus as he did so. “King Zeus,” he said, “grant me revenge on radiant Alexandros
            who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink
            from doing ill deeds in the house of his host.” </p>
          <p>[355] He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandros.
            Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the khiton by his flank, [360] but
            Alexandros swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son of Atreus drew his
            sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in
            three or four pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, [365] “Father
            Zeus, of all gods you are the most despiteful; I was sure of my revenge, but the sword
            has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed
            him.” </p>
          <p>With this he flew at Alexandros, caught him by the horsehair plume of his helmet, [370]
            and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of the helmet that went under his
            chin was choking him, and Menelaos would have dragged him off to his own great glory had
            not Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite been quick to mark [375] and to break the strap of ox-hide,
            so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the
            strong-greaved Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandros to run him through
            [380] with a spear, but Aphrodite snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him
            under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber. </p>
          <p>Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the Trojan women
            crowding round her. [385] She took the form of an old woman who used to dress wool for
            her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she
            plucked her by perfumed robe and said, [390] “Come here; Alexandros says you are to go
            to the house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in
            gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he
            was going to a dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>], or had done dancing
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>] and was sitting down.” </p>
          <p>[395] With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked the
            beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling eyes, she marveled at her
            and said, “Goddess, why do you thus beguile me? [400] Are you going to send me afield
            still further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Maeonia? Menelaos
            has just vanquished great Alexandros, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You
            are come here to betray me. [405] Go sit with Alexandros yourself; henceforth be goddess
            no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him and look after
            him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave—but me? [410] I
            shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women
            of Troy. Besides, I have grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] on my
            mind.” </p>
          <p>Aphrodite the shining was very angry, and said, “Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if you
            do, I shall leave you to your fate [415] and hate you as much as I have loved you. I
            will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and you shall come to a bad
            end.”</p>
          <p>Then Helen daughter of Zeus was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and went
            [420] in silence, following the superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] and unnoticed by the Trojan women. </p>
          <p>When they came to the house of Alexandros the maid-servants set about their work, but
            Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving goddess [425] took a seat and set
            it for her facing Alexandros. Then Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, sat down, and
            with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband. </p>
          <p>“So you are come from the fight,” said she; “would that you had fallen rather by the
            hand of that brave man who was my husband. [430] You used to brag that you were a better
            man with might [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] and spear than warlike Menelaos.
            Go, then, and challenge him again—but I should advise you not to do so, [435] for if you
            are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will soon fall by his spear.” </p>
          <p>And Paris answered, “Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This time, with the help
            of Athena, fair-haired Menelaos has vanquished me; [440] another time I may myself be
            victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me. Come, let us lie down together and
            make friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamored of you as at this moment—not even
            when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you— [445] not even
            when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of Kranae was I so
            enthralled by desire of you as now.” Then he led her towards the bed, and his wife went
            with him. </p>
          <p>Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus strode among the
            throng, [450] looking everywhere for godlike Alexandros, and no man, neither of the
            Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had seen him they were in no mind to
            hide him, for they all of them hated him as they did death itself. [455] Then Agamemnon,
            king of men, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has
            been with warlike Menelaos; therefore give back Helen of Argos with all her wealth, and
            pay such penalty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] [460] as shall be agreed
            upon, in testimony among them that shall be born hereafter.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in approval.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 4</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now the gods were sitting with Zeus in council upon the golden
            floor while the goddess Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as
            they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the town of Troy.
            [5] The son of Kronos then began to tease Hera, talking at her so as to provoke her.
            “Menelaos,” said he, “has two good friends among the goddesses, Hera of Argos, and
            Athena of Alalkomene, but they only sit still [10] and look on, while laughing Aphrodite
            keeps ever by the side of Alexandros to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just
            rescued him when he was sure that it was all over with him—for the victory really did
            lie with warlike Menelaos. We must consider what we shall do about all this; [15] shall
            we set them fighting anew or make peace between them? If you will agree to this last
            Menelaos can take back Helen of Argos and the city of Priam may remain still
            inhabited.”</p>
          <p>[20] Athena and Hera muttered their discontent as they sat side-by-side hatching
            mischief for the Trojans. Athena scowled at her father, for she was in a furious passion
            with him, and said nothing, but Hera could not contain herself. [25] “Dread son of
            Kronos,” said she, “what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>], then, to go for nothing, and the sweat that I have
            sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people together against Priam
            and his children? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your
            counsel.”</p>
          <p>[30] Zeus who gathers clouds was angry and answered, “My dear, what harm have Priam and
            his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on destroying the strong-founded city of
            Ilion? Will nothing do for you but you must go within their walls and [35] eat Priam
            raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your own way then; for I
            would not have this matter become a bone of contention between us. I say further, and
            lay my saying to your heart, [40] if ever I want to destroy a city belonging to friends
            of yours, you must not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in
            to you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of the
            sky, [45] there was none that I so much respected as sacred Ilion with Priam of the
            strong ash spear and his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting about my
            altar, nor the savor of burning fat, which is honor due to ourselves.”</p>
          <p>[50] “My own three favorite cities,” answered the ox-vision goddess Hera, “are Argos,
            Sparta, and Mycenae. Destroy them whenever you may be displeased with them. I shall not
            defend them and I shall not care. [55] Even if I did, and tried to stay you, I should
            take nothing by it, for you are much stronger than I am, but I will not have my own work
            wasted. I too am a god and of the same lineage as yourself. I am devious-devising
            Kronos’ eldest daughter, [60] and am honorable not on this ground only, but also because
            I am your wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take
            between us, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Athena [65] to go and
            take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first
            to break their oaths and set upon the far-famed Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>The father of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Athena, [70] “Go at once into
            the Trojan and Achaean armies, and contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break
            their oaths and set upon the far-famed Achaeans.” This was what Athena was already eager
            to do, so down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky
            [75] as some radiant meteor which the son of scheming Kronos has sent as a sign to
            mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows in its wake. [80] The
            Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld, and one would
            turn to his neighbor, saying, “Either we shall again have war and din of combat, or Zeus
            the lord of battle will now make peace between us.”</p>
          <p>[85] Thus did they converse. Then Athena took the form of Laodokos, son of Antenor, and
            went through the ranks of the Trojans to find godlike Pandaros, the terrifying son of
            Lykaon, a man blameless and powerful. She found him [90] standing among the stalwart
            heroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aisopos, so she went close up to him
            and said, “Brave and high-spirited son of Lykaon, will you do as I tell you? If you dare
            send an arrow at Menelaos [95] you will win honor and gratitude [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] from all the Trojans, and especially from prince
            Alexandros—he would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he could see warlike
            Menelaos, son of Atreus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. [100]
            Take your home aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer; vow that when you
            get home to your strong city of sacred Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling
            lambs in his honor.” </p>
          <p>His fool’s heart was persuaded, [105] and he took his bow from its case. This bow was
            made from the horns of a wild ibex that he had killed as it was bounding from a rock; he
            had stalked it, and it had fallen as the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were
            sixteen palms long, [110] and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them
            well down, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandaros had strung his bow he laid it
            carefully on the ground, and his brave followers held their shields before him lest the
            Achaeans should set upon him [115] before he had shot warlike Menelaos. Then he opened
            the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had never yet been shot, fraught
            with the pangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo,
            the famous archer, [120] vowing that when he got home to his strong city of sacred Zelea
            he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honor. He laid the notch of the
            arrow on the ox-hide bowstring, and drew both notch and string to his breast till the
            arrowhead was near the bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle [125] he let
            fly, and the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on over the heads
            of the throng. </p>
          <p>But the blessed gods did not forget you, O Menelaos, and Zeus’ daughter, driver of the
            spoil, was the first to stand before you and ward off the piercing arrow. [130] She
            turned it from his skin as a mother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping
            sweetly; she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over
            his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round
            him. [135] It went right through this and through the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it
            also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or
            arrows; it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went
            through it and grazed the top of the skin, [140] so that blood began flowing from the
            wound. </p>
          <p>As when some woman of Maeonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece of ivory that
            is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid up in a treasure house—many a
            charioteer wants to bear it, [145] but the king keeps it as an ornament [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>] of which both horse and driver may be proud—even so,
            O Menelaos, were your shapely thighs and your legs down to your fair ankles stained with
            blood. </p>
          <p>When King Agamemnon, lord of men, saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,
            [150] and so was brave Menelaos himself till he saw that the barbs of the arrow and the
            thread that bound the arrowhead to the shaft were still outside the wound. Then he took
            heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh as he held Menelaos’ hand in his own, and his
            comrades made moan in concert. [155] “Dear brother, “he cried, “I have been the death of
            you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans
            have trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the oath, the blood of
            lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust
            shall not be vain. [160] If he that rules Olympus fulfill it not here and now, he will
            yet fulfill it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives and with their
            wives and children. The day will surely come when mighty Ilion shall be laid low, [165]
            with Priam of the strong ash spear and Priam’s people, when the son of Kronos from his
            high throne shall overshadow them with his terrifying aegis in punishment of their
            present treachery. This shall surely be; but how, Menelaos, shall I have grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] for you, [170] if it be your lot now to die? I should
            return to Argos the thirsty as a by-word, for the Achaeans will at once go home. We
            shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen of Argos, and the
            earth will rot your bones [175] as you lie here at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled.
            Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your tomb and say, ‘Ever thus may Agamemnon
            wreak his vengeance; he brought his army in vain; [180] he is gone home to his own land
            with empty ships, and has left brave Menelaos behind him.’ Thus will one of them say,
            and may the earth then swallow me.” </p>
          <p>But fair-haired Menelaos reassured him and said, “Take heart, and do not alarm the
            people; [185] the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer belt of
            burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and the belt of mail which
            the bronze-smiths made me.” </p>
          <p>And powerful Agamemnon answered, “I trust, dear Menelaos, that it may be even so, [190]
            but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it to relieve your
            pain.” </p>
          <p>He then said to Talthybios, “Talthybios, tell Makhaon, son to the great physician,
            blameless Asklepios, [195] to come and see Menelaos immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian
            archer has wounded him with an arrow—to our grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >penthos</foreign>], and to his own great glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>Talthybios did as he was told, and went about the army of warriors, [200] trying to
            find Makhaon. Presently he found him standing amid the brave warriors who had followed
            him from horse-pasturing Tricca; then he went up to him and said, “Son of Asklepios,
            powerful King Agamemnon says [205] you are to come and see warlike Menelaos immediately.
            Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow—to our grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] and to his own great glory [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and Makhaon was moved to go. They passed through the vast army of
            the Achaeans [210] and went on till they came to the place where fair-haired Menelaos
            had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains gathered in a circle round him.
            Makhaon passed into the middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt,
            bending its barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. [215] He undid the
            burnished belt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the
            bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood and
            applied some soothing drugs which Cheiron had given to Asklepios out of the good will he
            bore him.</p>
          <p>[220] While they were thus busy about Menelaos of the great war cry, the Trojans came
            forward against them, for they had put on their armor, and now renewed the fight. </p>
          <p>You would not have then found radiant Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and unwilling to
            fight, [225] but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot rich with bronze and his
            panting steeds in charge of his attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>]
            Eurymedon, son of Ptolemaios the son of Peiraios, and bade him hold them in readiness
            against the time [230] his limbs should weary of going about and giving orders to so
            many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw men hastening to the front he
            stood by them and cheered them on. “Argives,” said he, “slacken not one whit in your
            onset; [235] father Zeus will be no helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to
            break their oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; we
            shall take their city and carry off their wives and children in our ships.”</p>
          <p>[240] But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined to fight.
            “Argives,” he cried, “cowardly miserable creatures, have you no shame to stand here like
            frightened fawns who, when they can no longer scud over the plain, [245] huddle
            together, but show no fight? You are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait
            till the Trojans reach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see whether
            the son of Kronos will hold his hand over you to protect you?”</p>
          <p>[250] Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through the
            crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus, who was at their head,
            fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the
            rear. [255] Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke to him fairly. “Idomeneus,”
            said he, “I treat you with greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans,
            whether in war or in other things, or at table. When the princes [260] are mixing my
            choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed allowance, but your
            cup is kept always full like my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,
            therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have been always proud to be.”</p>
          <p>[265] Idomeneus, lord of the Cretans, answered, “I will be a trusty comrade, as I
            promised you from the first I would be. Urge on the other flowing-haired Achaeans, that
            we may join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon [270] their covenants.
            Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first to break their
            oaths and to attack us.” </p>
          <p>The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two Ajaxes arming
            themselves amid a mass of foot-soldiers. [275] As when a goat-herd from some high post
            watches a storm drive over the deep sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>]
            before the west wind—black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws towards
            him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave— [280] even thus did the
            ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with
            shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them. [285] “No need,” he cried,
            “to give orders to such leaders of the bronze-armored Argives as you are, for of your
            own selves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by father Zeus,
            Athena, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, [290] for the city of Priam would
            then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should destroy it.” </p>
          <p>With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians,
            who was marshalling his men and urging them on, [295] in company with Pelagon, Alastor,
            Khromios, Haimon, and Bias, shepherd of his people. He placed his horsemen with their
            chariots and horses in the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom
            he could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, [300] that they
            might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders to the horsemen first, bidding
            them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid confusion. “Let no man,” he said,
            “relying on his strength or skill in charioteering, get before the others and engage
            singly with the Trojans, [305] nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your
            attack; but let each when he meets an enemy’s chariot throw his spear from his own; this
            will be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns and strongholds; in this
            way was their thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>[310] Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight, and King
            Agamemnon was glad. “I wish,” he said to him, that your limbs were as supple and your
            strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] as sure as your judgment is; [315] but
            age, the common enemy of humankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it had fallen
            upon some other, and that you were still young.” </p>
          <p>And Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, answered, “Son of Atreus, I too would gladly be the
            man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; [320] but the gods will not give us everything
            at one and the same time. I was then young, and now I am old; still I can go with my
            horsemen and give them that counsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding of
            the spear I leave to those [325] who are younger and have more force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] than myself.” </p>
          <p>Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus, son of Peteos, driver
            of horses, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians loud of tongue in
            battle. Near him also tarried resourceful Odysseus, [330] with his sturdy Kephallēnians
            round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans
            had only just begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for some other columns
            of the Achaeans [335] to attack the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw this
            Agamemnon rebuked them and said, “Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning,
            heart of guile, [340] why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two should
            be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you are ever foremost
            to accept my invitation when we councilors of the Achaeans are holding feast. [345] You
            are glad enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as long as you
            please, whereas now you would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the
            enemy in front of you.”</p>
          <p>Resourceful Odysseus glared at him and answered, [350] “Son of Atreus, what are you
            talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are in full fight
            with the Trojans, breakers of horses, you shall see, if you care to do so, that the
            father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost [355] of them. You are talking
            idly.” </p>
          <p>When Agamemnon saw that Odysseus was angry, he smiled pleasantly at him and withdrew
            his words. “Odysseus,” said he, “noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, excellent in all
            good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders to give you, [360] for I know your
            heart is right, and that you and I are of a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for
            what I have said, and if any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.”
            He then left them and went on to others. </p>
          <p>[365] Presently he saw the son of Tydeus, noble high-spirited Diomedes, standing by his
            chariot and horses, with Sthenelos the son of Kapaneus beside him; whereon he began to
            upbraid him. [370] “Son of Tydeus, the daring breaker of horses,” he said, “why stand
            you cowering here upon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever
            ahead of his men when leading them on against the foe—so, at least, say they that saw
            him in battle, for I never set eyes [375] upon him myself. They say that there was no
            man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in company with
            godlike Polyneikes [Polynices] to recruit his forces, for they were levying war against
            the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them.
            [380] The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Zeus dissuaded them by
            showing them unfavorable omens [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign> pl.]. Tydeus,
            therefore, and Polyneikes [Polynices] went their way. When they had got as far as the
            deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aisopos, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their
            envoy, [385] and he found the Kadmeians gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the
            house of mighty Eteokles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding himself
            single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each
            one of them was [390] at once victorious, so mightily did Athena help him. The Kadmeians
            who lash their horses were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youths with
            two chiefs—the godlike hero Maion, son of Haimon, [395] and Polyphontes, stubborn in
            battle, son of Autophonos—at their head, to lie in wait for him on his return journey;
            but Tydeus slew every man of them, save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to
            divine omens. Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. [400] His son can talk more glibly, but he
            cannot fight as his father did.” </p>
          <p>Strong Diomedes made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon; but the
            son of Kapaneus the glorious took up his words and said, <seg rend="subscript"
            >404</seg> “Son of Atreus! Don’t warp your talk when you know how to speak clearly!
            [405] We boast to be much better than our fathers. <seg rend="subscript">406</seg> We
            even captured the foundations of seven-gated Thebes, <seg rend="subscript"
            >407</seg> having mustered a smaller army against a stronger fortress, <seg
              rend="subscript">408</seg> and having heeded the signs of the gods and the help of
              Zeus. <seg rend="subscript">409</seg> But they perished, by their own wantonness.
            [410] So do not bestow on our fathers an honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>]
            that is like ours.” </p>
          <p>Darkly strong Diomedes looked sternly at him and said, “Hold your peace, my friend, as
            I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the strong-greaved Achaeans
            forward, [415] for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the shame
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] if we are vanquished. Therefore let us
            acquit ourselves with valor.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, [420] and his armor rang so fiercely about his
            body that even a brave man might well have been scared to hear it. </p>
          <p>As when the mighty sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] that thunders on the
            beach when the west wind has lashed it into fury—it has reared its head afar and now
            [425] comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the jagged
            rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions—even so did the serried phalanxes of the
            Danaans march steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but
            the men said never a word; no man would think it, [430] for huge as the mass of warriors
            was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in their
            obedience; and as they marched the armor about their bodies glistened in the sun. But
            the clamor of the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to
            be milked in the yards of some rich master of flocks, [435] and bleat incessantly in
            answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but
            their tongues were diverse, and they came from many different places. These were
            inspired of Arēs, but the others by owl-vision Athena— [440] and with them came Panic,
            Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend of manslaughtering Arēs, who,
            from being at first but low in stature, grows till she raises her head to the sky,
            though her feet are still on earth. She it was that went about among them and flung down
            discord [445] to the waxing of sorrow with even hand between them. </p>
          <p>When they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield and spear with
            spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat one upon another, and there was a
            tramp as of a great multitude— [450] death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and
            slayers, and the earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly
            down their deep channels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, [455] and the
            shepherd on the hillside hears their roaring from afar—even such was the toil [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and uproar of the armies as they joined in
            battle. </p>
          <p>First Antilokhos slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Ekhepolos, son of Thalysios,
            fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the projecting part of his helmet and drove
            the spear into his brow; [460] the point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled
            his eyes; headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped
            King Elephenor the powerful, son of Khalkodon and chief of the proud Abantes, [465]
            began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling around him, in haste to
            strip him of his armor. But his purpose was not for long; high-hearted Agenor saw him
            hauling the body away, and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear—for as he
            stooped his side was left unprotected by his shield— [470] and thus he perished. Then
            the fight between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon
            each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other. </p>
          <p>Right away Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisios, son of Anthemion, whom
            his mother [475] bore by the banks of the Simoeis, as she was coming down from Mount
            Ida, where she had been with her parents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named
            Simoeisios, but he did not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off
            untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, [480] who struck him in the breast by the right
            nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through his
            shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some
            mere, and its top is thick with branches. [485] Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its
            roots that he may fashion a piece for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies
            seasoning by the waterside. In such a way did illustrious Ajax fell to earth Simoeisios,
            son of Anthemion. Then Antiphos of the gleaming breastplate, [490] son of Priam, hurled
            a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leukos, the brave comrade
            of Odysseus, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisios over to the other
            side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Odysseus was furious when he
            saw Leukos slain, [495] and strode in full armor through the front ranks till he was
            quite close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as
            he did so. His dart was not sped in vain, for it struck Demokoön, the bastard son of
            Priam, [500] who had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father’s
            fast-running mares. Odysseus, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his
            spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the other side of his
            forehead. Then darkness veiled his eyes, and his armor rang rattling round him as he
            fell heavily to the ground. [505] Glorious Hector, and they that were in front, then
            gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing further
            forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from Pergamon and called aloud to the
            Trojans, for he was displeased. “Trojans, breakers of horses,” he cried, “rush on the
            foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten [510] by the Argives. Their skins are not
            stone nor iron that when you hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son
            of lovely-haired Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the ships.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Zeus’ terrifying
            daughter, [515] the Trito-born, went about among the army of the Achaeans, and urged
            them forward whenever she beheld them slackening. </p>
          <p>Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynkeus, for he was struck by a jagged stone near
            the ankle of his right leg. He that hurled it was [520] Peiroös, son of Imbrasos, chief
            of the Thracians, who had come from Ainos; the bones and both the tendons were crushed
            by the pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes
            stretched out his hands towards his comrades. [525] But Peiroös, who had wounded him,
            sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out
            upon the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of
            Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his
            lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled [530] the spear out of his chest, and then
            drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he died; but he did not
            strip him of his armor, for his Thracian comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at
            the top of their heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for
            all his great stature and valor; [535] so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses lay
            stretched on earth near to one another, the one chief of the Thracians and the other of
            the bronze-armored Epeioi; and many another fell round them. </p>
          <p>And now no man would have made light of the fighting [540] if he could have gone about
            among it unscathed and unwounded, with Athena leading him by the hand, and protecting
            him from the storm of spears and arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay
            stretched side-by-side face downwards upon the earth.</p>

        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 5</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Then Pallas Athena put power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >menos</foreign>] and courage into Diomedes, son of Tydeus, that he might excel all
            the other Argives, and cover himself with glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>]. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet [5] like
            the star that shines most radiantly in summer after its bath in the waters of
            Okeanos—even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as she bade him
            speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the fight. </p>
          <p>Now there was a certain rich and honorable man among the Trojans, [10] priest of
            Hephaistos, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and Idaios, both of them
            skilled in all the arts of war. These two came forward from the main body of Trojans,
            and set upon Diomedes, he being on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they
            were close up to one another, [15] Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over
            Diomedes’ left shoulder without hitting him. Diomedes then threw, and his spear sped not
            in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from [20] his
            chariot. Idaios did not dare to bestride his brother’s body, but sprang from the chariot
            and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother’s fate; whereon Hephaistos saved
            him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly
            overwhelmed with grief; [25] but the son of high-hearted Tydeus drove off with the
            horses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The high-hearted Trojans were
            scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying
            dead by his chariot. Owl-vision Athena, therefore, [30] took Arēs by the hand and said,
            “Arēs, Arēs, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now leave the
            Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which of the two Zeus will grant the
            victory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mēnis</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>[35] So saying, she drew violent Arēs out of the battle, and set him down upon the
            steep banks of the Skamandros. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans back, and each
            one of their chieftains killed his man. First King Agamemnon flung mighty Odios, chief
            of the Halizonoi, from his chariot. [40] The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad
            of his back, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and
            went right through his chest, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily
            to the ground. </p>
          <p>Then Idomeneus killed Phaistos, son of Boros the Maeonian, who had come from Tarne.
            Mighty spear-renowned Idomeneus [45] speared him on the right shoulder as he was
            mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as he fell heavily from
            the car. </p>
          <p>The attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Idomeneus spoiled
            him of his armor, while Menelaos, son of Atreus, killed [50] Skamandrios the son of
            Strophios, a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Artemis herself had taught him
            how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but neither
            she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, [55] for the spear of Menelaos
            the spear-famed struck him in the back as he was fleeing; it struck him between the
            shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armor rang
            rattling round him. Meriones then killed Phereklos the son of Tekton, who was the son of
            Harmon, [60] a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship, for
            Pallas Athena had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships for Alexandros, which
            were the beginning of all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on
            Alexandros himself; for he heeded not the decrees of the gods. [65] Meriones overtook
            him as he was fleeing, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went
            through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell
            forward on his knees. </p>
          <p>Meges, moreover, slew Pedaios, son of Antenor, [70] who, though he was a bastard, had
            been brought up by lovely Theano as one of her own children, for the love she bore her
            husband. The son of Phyleus the spear-famed got close up to him and drove a spear into
            the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all among his teeth, [75] so he bit the
            cold bronze, and fell dead in the dust. </p>
          <p>And Eurypylos, son of Euaimon, killed radiant Hypsenor, the son of high-hearted
            Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Skamandros, <seg rend="subscript"
              >78</seg> and he got honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] from the district
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], like a god. Eurypylos, the shining son of
            Euaimon, gave him chase [80] as he was fleeing before him, smote him with his sword upon
            the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the ground, and
            the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes.</p>
          <p>[85] Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of Tydeus, you
            could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across
            the plain like a winter torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, [90]
            no walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from the sky,
            but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong
            man hand has reclaimed—even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by
            the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught. </p>
          <p>[95] Now when the shining son of Lykaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the
            Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part of his cuirass
            near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the metal [100] and pierced the flesh,
            so that the cuirass was covered with blood. Then the son of Lykaon shouted in triumph,
            “High-hearted Horsemen Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he
            will not hold out much longer if King [105] Apollo was indeed with me when I sped here
            from Lycia.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he boast; but his arrow had not killed Diomedes, who withdrew and made for the
            chariot and horses of Sthenelos, the son of Kapaneus. “Dear son of Kapaneus,” said he,
            “come down from your chariot, [110] and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.” </p>
          <p>Sthenelos sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound, whereon the blood
            came spouting out through the hole that had been made in his khiton. Then Diomedes of
            the great war cry prayed, saying, [115] “Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, the
            one who cannot be worn down, if ever you loved my father well and stood by him in the
            thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a spear’s throw of that
            man and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is
            boasting that [120] I shall not see the light of the sun much longer.” </p>
          <p>Thus he prayed, and Pallas Athena heard him; she made his limbs supple and quickened
            his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and said, “Fear not, Diomedes, to
            do battle with the Trojans, [125] for I have set in your heart the spirit of your
            father, the charioteer Tydeus. Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that
            you know gods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle,
            [130] do not fight him; but should Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite come, strike her with your
            spear and wound her.” </p>
          <p>When she had said this owl-vision Athena went away, and the son of Tydeus again took
            his place among the foremost fighters, [135] three times more fierce even than he had
            been before. He was like a lion that some mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed,
            as he is springing over the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has
            roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, [140] so he takes shelter under
            cover of the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered
            in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall.
            Even thus did strong Diomedes go furiously about among the Trojans. </p>
          <p>He killed Astynoos, and Hyperion, shepherd of his people, [145] the one with a thrust
            of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with a sword cut on the
            collarbone, that severed his shoulder from his neck and back. He let both of them lie,
            and went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidos, sons of the old man who read [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] dreams, Eurydamas: [150] they never came back for
            him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomedes made an end of them. He then gave
            chase to Xanthos and Thoön, the two sons of Phainops, both of them very dear to him, for
            he was now worn out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. [155]
            But Diomedes took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he
            nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among
            themselves. </p>
          <p>Then he came upon two sons of Priam, [160] Ekhemmon and Khromios, as they were both in
            one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer
            when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both
            from their chariot and stripped the armor from their bodies. [165] Then he gave their
            horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships. </p>
          <p>When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through the fight amid
            the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandaros the godlike. When he had found the
            brave son of Lykaon he said, [170] “Pandaros, where is now your bow, your winged arrows,
            and your fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] as an archer, in respect of
            which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then
            your hands to Zeus and send an arrow at this man who is going so masterfully about,
            [175] and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave
            man—unless indeed he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,
            and has set his hand against them in his anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >mēnis</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>And the son of Lykaon answered, [180] “Aeneas, I take him for none other than the
            valiant son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet, and by his
            horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is the man I say he is, [185] he
            is not making all this havoc without divine help, but has some god by his side who is
            shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I
            have taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through
            the breastplate of his cuirass; [190] and I was sure I should send him hurrying to the
            world below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry
            with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father’s stables there are
            eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths [195] spread
            over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses, champing barley and rye; my
            old father Lykaon urged me again and again when I was at home and on the point of
            starting, to take chariots and horses with me [200] that I might lead the Trojans in
            battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much better if I had done so,
            but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill, and I was
            afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at
            home and came on foot to Ilion [205] armed only with my bow and arrows. These it seems,
            are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus,
            and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more furious. I did
            ill to take my bow down from its peg [210] on the day I led my band of Trojans to lovely
            Ilion in Hector’s service [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>], and if ever I get
            home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may
            some one cut my head off then and there [215] if I do not break the bow and set it on a
            hot fire—such pranks as it plays me.” </p>
          <p>Aeneas answered, “Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go against this man
            with chariot and horses [220] and bring him to a trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and
            note how cleverly the horses of Tros can speed here and there over the plain in pursuit
            or flight. [225] If Zeus again grants glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us
            safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the
            car to fight, or else do you wait this man’s onset while I look after the horses.” </p>
          <p>[230] “Aeneas,” replied the shining son of Lykaon, “take the reins and drive; if we
            have to flee before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for their own driver. If
            they miss the sound of your voice when they expect it they may be frightened, and refuse
            to take us out of the fight. [235] The son of high-hearted Tydeus will then kill both of
            us and take the horses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with
            my spear.” </p>
          <p>They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed [240] towards the son of Tydeus.
            Sthenelos, shining son of Kapaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomedes, “Diomedes, son
            of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes speeding towards you, [245] both of
            them men of might the one a skilful archer, Pandaros son of Lykaon, the other, Aeneas,
            whose father is Anchises the blameless, while his mother is Aphrodite. Mount the chariot
            and let us retreat. Do not, [250] I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get
            killed.”</p>
          <p>Darkly strong Diomedes looked angrily at him and answered: “Talk not of flight, for I
            shall not listen to you: I am of a lineage that knows neither flight nor fear, and my
            limbs are as yet unwearied. [255] I am in no mind to mount, but will go against them
            even as I am; Pallas Athena bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them
            escape, their steeds shall not take both back again. I say further, [260] and lay my
            saying to your heart—if Athena sees fit to grant me the glory of killing both, stay your
            horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you spring
            Aeneas’ horses and drive them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. [265] They are of
            the stock that great Zeus of the wide brows gave to Tros in payment for his son
            Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole the
            blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon’s knowledge, [270] and they bore him
            six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall
            win great glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] if we can take them.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse, [275] but the other two had now driven close up to them, and
            the shining son of Lykaon spoke first. “Great and mighty son,” said he, “of noble
            Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try with my spear.” </p>
          <p>[280] He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the shield of
            the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on till it reached the
            breastplate. Then the shining son of Lykaon shouted out and said, “You are hit clean
            through the belly; [285] you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is
            mine.” </p>
          <p>But strong Diomedes all undismayed made answer, “You have missed, not hit, and before
            you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall glut tough-shielded Arēs
            with his blood.”</p>
          <p>[290] With this he hurled his spear, and Athena guided it on to Pandaros’ nose near the
            eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of
            his tongue, coming out under his chin, and his glistening armor rang rattling round him
            [295] as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was
            robbed of life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] and strength. </p>
          <p>Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing lest the Achaeans
            should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion in the pride of strength, [300] with
            shield and spear before him and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first
            that should dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and
            great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft
            with ease unaided, [305] and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns
            in the joint that is called the “cup-bone.” The stone crushed this joint, and broke both
            the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees,
            and propped himself with his hand resting on the ground [310] till the darkness of night
            fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had
            not his mother, Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite, who had conceived him by Anchises when he was
            herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her
            dear son. [315] She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment,
            lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him. </p>
          <p>Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But Sthenelos the son of
            Kapaneus was not unmindful of the orders [320] that Diomedes of the great war cry had
            given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the reins
            to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas’ fluttering-maned horses and drove
            them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. [325] When he had so done he gave them over
            to his chosen comrade Deipylos, whom he valued above all others as the one who was most
            like-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own
            chariot, seized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.</p>
          <p>[330] Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in hand, for
            he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that can lord it among men in
            battle like Athena or Enyo, the waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he
            caught her up, [335] he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate
            hand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for her, and
            pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood,
            [340] or ikhōr, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the
            wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as
            ours, and are immortal. Aphrodite wailed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo
            caught him in his arms, [345] and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest some fast-mounted
            Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and Diomedes of the great war
            cry shouted out as he left her, “Daughter of Zeus, leave war and battle alone, can you
            not be contented with beguiling silly women? [350] If you meddle with fighting you will
            get what will make you shudder at the very name of war.” </p>
          <p>The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the wind, drew her from
            the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all besmirched. [355] She found fierce Arēs
            waiting on the left of the battle, with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a
            cloud; whereon she fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have
            his horses. “Dear brother,” she cried, “save me, and give me your horses [360] to take
            me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus,
            who would now fight even with father Zeus.” </p>
          <p>Thus she spoke, and Arēs gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted the chariot
            sick and sorry at heart, [365] while Iris sat beside her and took the reins in her hand.
            She lashed her horses on and they flew forward nothing loath, till in a trice they were
            at high Olympus, where the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed
            them from the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; [370] but bright Aphrodite
            flung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and
            caressed her, saying, “Which of the celestial beings has been treating you in this way,
            as though you had been doing something wrong in the face of day?”</p>
          <p>[375] And laughter-loving Aphrodite answered, “Proud Diomedes, the son of high-hearted
            Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best of all
            humankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between Trojans and Achaeans,
            [380] for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with the immortals.”</p>
          <p>“Bear it, my child,” replied Dione, shining among divinities, “and make the best of it.
            We dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay much
            suffering on one another. [385] Arēs had to suffer when Otos and strong Ephialtes,
            children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned
            in a vessel of bronze. Arēs would have then perished had not fair Eeriboia, surpassingly
            lovely stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, [390] told Hermes, who stole him away when he
            was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his bondage. Hera, again, suffered
            when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed
            arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hādēs, [395] when this
            same man, the son of aegis-bearing Zeus, hit him with an arrow even at the gates of
            Hādēs, and hurt him badly. Then Hādēs went to the house of Zeus on great Olympus, angry
            and full of grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]; and the arrow [400] in his
            brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paieon healed him by spreading soothing
            herbs on the wound, for Hādēs was not of mortal mold. Daring, headstrong, evildoer who
            thought not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. [405] And now
            owl-vision Athena has egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for
            not reflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his children
            prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. [410] Let, then, the son of
            Tydeus, breaker of horses, see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger
            than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aigialeia, high-spirited daughter of Adrastos,
            rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded lord, [415]
            Diomedes, the bravest of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>So saying, she wiped the ikhōr from the wrist of her daughter with both hands, whereon
            the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Athena and Hera, who were looking on,
            began to taunt Zeus son of Kronos with their mocking talk, [420] and Athena was first to
            speak. “Father Zeus,” said she, “do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must
            have been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is
            so very fond, and while caressing one or other of them [425] she must have torn her
            delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman’s brooch.” </p>
          <p>The father of gods and men smiled, and called golden Aphrodite to his side. “My child,”
            said he, “it has not been given you to be a warrior. Attend, henceforth, to your own
            delightful matrimonial duties, [430] and leave all this fighting to sudden Arēs and to
            Athena.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse. But Diomedes of the great war cry sprang upon Aeneas, though he
            knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the mighty god,
            [435] so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his armor. Thrice did he
            spring forward with might and main to slay him, and three times did Apollo beat back his
            gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the fourth time, equal [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>], Apollo shouted to him with a terrifying voice and said, [440]
            “Take note, son of Tydeus, and draw back. Do not try, with regard to the gods, <seg
              rend="subscript">441</seg> to think thoughts equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >īsa</foreign>] to their thoughts, since our kind and your kind are not at all the
            same [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">homoion</foreign>],  <seg rend="subscript">442</seg> I
            mean, the lineage of the immortal gods and the lineage of humans who walk the
            earth.” </p>
          <p>The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of the god, while Apollo [445] took Aeneas out of the
            crowd and set him in sacred Pergamon, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty
            sanctuary, Leto and Artemis of the showering arrows healed him and made him glorious to
            behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith [450] in the likeness of
            Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and radiant Achaeans hacked at the
            bucklers about one another’s breasts, hewing each other’s round shields and light
            hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to violent Arēs, [445] “Arēs, Arēs, bane
            of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,
            who would now fight even with father Zeus, and draw him out of the battle? He first went
            up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon
            me too, equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to a superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>[460] He then took his seat on the top of Pergamon, while manslaughtering Arēs went
            about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness of fleet Akamas
            chief of the Thracians. “Sons of Priam, the king whom the gods love,” said he, [465]
            “how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would you wait
            till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of great-hearted Anchises has fallen,
            he whom we held in as high honor as radiant Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our
            brave comrade from the stress of the fight.”</p>
          <p>[470] With these words he put heart and spirit into them all. Then Sarpedon rebuked
            Hector very sternly. “Hector,” said he, “where is your prowess now? <seg
              rend="subscript">473</seg> Perhaps you think that you will protect the city [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">polis</foreign>] all alone, without the fighting men and the allies,
            with your brothers and brothers-in-law. [475] I see not one of them here; they cower as
            hounds before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have
            come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the whirling river Xanthos, [480] where
            I have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;
            nevertheless, I head my Lycian warriors and stand my ground against any who would fight
            me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, [485] while you look on,
            without even bidding your men stand firm in defense of their wives. See that you fall
            not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they destroy
            your fair city right then and there. [490] Keep this before your mind night and day, and
            beseech the chiefs of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away their
            reproaches from you.” </p>
          <p>So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. <seg rend="subscript"
            >494</seg> Straightaway he [= Hector] leapt out of his chariot, armor and all, hitting
            the ground, [495] and went about among the army of warriors brandishing his two spears,
            exhorting the men to fight and raising the terrifying cry of battle. Then they rallied
            and again faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not
            driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, [500]
            when men are winnowing—while golden-haired Demeter blows with the wind to sort [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] the chaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow
            whiter and whiter—even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses’ hooves
            raised to the firmament of the sky, [505] as their drivers turned them back to battle,
            and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Arēs, to help the Trojans, covered
            them in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus
            Apollo of the glowing sword had told him [510] that when he saw Pallas Athena leave the
            fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans—for it was she who was helping
            the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart
            with valor, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were overjoyed [515] at
            seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it had
            all happened, for they were too busy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] with the
            turmoil raised by manslaughtering Arēs and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their
            midst. </p>
          <p>The two Ajaxes, Odysseus, and Diomedes [520] cheered the Danaans on, fearless of the
            fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which the son of Kronos has
            spread upon the mountain tops when there is no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the
            other [525] boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all
            directions—even so did the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The
            son of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. “My friends,” said he, “acquit
            yourselves like brave men, [530] and shun dishonor in one another’s eyes amid the stress
            of battle. They that shun dishonor more often live than get killed, but they that flee
            save neither life nor fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the front rank, the
            comrade of high-hearted Aeneas, [535] Deikoön, son of Pergasos, whom the Trojans held in
            no less honor than the sons of Priam, for he was ever quick to place himself among the
            foremost. The spear of powerful King Agamemnon struck his shield and went right through
            it, for the shield stayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his
            belly, [540] and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the
            ground. </p>
          <p>Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Krethon and Orsilokhos. Their father
            was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere and was descended from the river
            [545] Alpheus, whose broad stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat
            Orsilokhos, who ruled over much people and was father to high-hearted Diokles, who in
            his turn begat twin sons, Krethon and Orsilokhos, well skilled in all the arts of war.
            [550] These, when they grew up, went to Ilion with the Argive fleet for the honor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] of Menelaos and Agamemnon, sons of Atreus,
            and there they both of them met their end [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>]. As
            two lions [555] whom their dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to
            plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed by the hand of
            man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, [560] and fell like high pine-trees to the
            ground. </p>
          <p>Brave Menelaos pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the front, clad in
            gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Arēs egged him on to do so with intent
            that he should be killed by Aeneas; [565] but Antilokhos the son of high-hearted Nestor
            saw him and sprang forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all
            their labor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] to nothing; when, therefore
            Aeneas and Menelaos were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to do
            battle, [570] Antilokhos placed himself by the side of Menelaos. Aeneas, bold though he
            was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side-by-side in front of him, so they drew the
            bodies of Krethon and Orsilokhos to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two poor
            men into the hands of their comrades. [575] They then turned back and fought in the
            front ranks. </p>
          <p>They killed high-hearted Pylaimenes peer of Arēs, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors.
            Menelaos the spear-famed son of Atreus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing
            on his chariot, [580] while Antilokhos hit his charioteer and attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] Mydon, the brave son of Atymnios, who was turning
            his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched
            with white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust. Antilokhos rushed towards him and
            struck him on the temples with his sword, [585] whereon he fell head-first from the
            chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders buried
            deep in the dust—for he had fallen on sandy soil till his horses kicked him and laid him
            flat on the ground, as Antilokhos lashed them and drove them off to the army of the
            Achaeans.</p>
          <p>[590] But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry rushed towards
            them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans. Arēs and dread goddess Enyo led
            them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of battle, while Arēs wielded a monstrous
            spear, and went about, [595] now in front of Hector and now behind him. </p>
          <p>Diomedes of the great war cry shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a
            wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river rolling swiftly
            to the sea—he sees its boiling waters and starts back in fear— [600] even so did the son
            of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his men, “My friends, how can we wonder that
            glorious Hector wields the spear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him,
            and now Arēs is with him in the likeness of mortal man. [605] Keep your faces therefore
            towards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both in one chariot,
            Menesthes and Ankhialos, heroes well versed in war. [610] Great Ajax, son of Telamon,
            pitied them in their fall; he came close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphios the
            son of Selagos, a man of great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much wheat-growing
            land, but his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. [615] Telemonian
            Ajax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell
            heavily to the ground. Then shining Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armor, but
            the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. [620] He planted
            his heel upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him
            that he could not strip the goodly armor from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,
            moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that he dared not stay;
            [625] great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten
            back. </p>
          <p>Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand of fate
            impelled Tlepolemos, the son of Hēraklēs, a man both brave and of great stature, to
            fight godlike Sarpedon; [630] so the two, son and grandson of great Zeus, drew near to
            one another, and Tlepolemos spoke first. “Sarpedon,” said he, “councilor of the Lycians,
            why should you come skulking here, you who are a man of peace? [635] They lie who call
            you son of aegis-bearing Zeus, for you are little like those who were of old his
            children. Far other was Hēraklēs, my own brave and lion-hearted father, [640] who came
            here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow
            him, destroyed the city of Ilion and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a
            coward, and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming
            from Lycia, [645] you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of Hādēs
            vanquished by my hand.” </p>
          <p>And Sarpedon, chief of the Lycians, answered, “Tlepolemos, your father overthrew Ilion
            by reason of haughty Laomedon’s folly [650] in refusing payment to one who had served
            him well. He would not give your father the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As
            for yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and
            your spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] to Hādēs of the noble
            steeds.”</p>
          <p>[655] Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemos upraised his spear. They threw at the same
            moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his throat; the spear went right
            through, and the darkness of death fell upon his eyes. [660] Tlepolemos’ spear struck
            Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the
            bone, but his father as yet warded off destruction from him. </p>
          <p>His comrades bore godlike Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the weight of the
            spear [665] that was dragging from his wound. They were in such haste and stress
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] as they bore him that no one thought of
            drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the
            strong-greaved Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemos, whereon radiant Odysseus
            [670] was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether
            to pursue the son of Zeus the loud-thundering, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank
            and file; it was not decreed, however, [675] that he should slay the son of Zeus;
            Athena, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Koiranos,
            Alastor, Khromios, Alkandros, Halios, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet
            more, [680] had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in
            his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him
            coming, and besought him, saying, “Son of Priam, let me not be here to fall into the
            hands of the Danaans. [685] Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden the
            hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.” </p>
          <p>Hector of the shining helmet made him no answer, [690] but rushed onward to fall at
            once upon the Achaeans and kill many among them. His radiant comrades then bore godlike
            Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Zeus’ spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and
            comrade, [695] drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon lost control of his
            life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>], and a mist came over his eyes.
            Presently he came to again, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave
            him new life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Arēs and
            bronze-armored Hector, [700] nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Arēs was
            with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned towards the foe. Who,
            then, was first and who last to be slain by Arēs the brazen and Priam’s son Hector?
            [705] They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes, the renowned charioteer, Trēkhos, the
            Aetolian warrior, Oinomaos, Helenos, the son of Oinops, and Oresbios of the gleaming
            belt, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake [710] with the
            other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>].</p>
          <p>Now when the goddess Hera saw the Argives thus falling, she said to Athena, “Alas,
            daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, the one who cannot be worn down, [715] the promise we
            made Menelaos that he should not return till he had destroyed the strong-walled city of
            Ilion will be of none effect if we let Arēs rage thus furiously. Let us go into the fray
            at once.” </p>
          <p>Athena did not [720] gainsay her. Then Hera, the august goddess, daughter of great
            Kronos, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all speed fitted on the
            eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either side of the iron axle-tree. The spikes
            of the wheels were of gold, imperishable, [725] and over these there was a tire of
            bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle
            upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it
            had a double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the car there went a pole
            of silver, [730] on to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of
            gold that were to go under the necks of the horses. Then Hera put her steeds under the
            yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">733</seg> As for Athena, daughter of Zeus who has the aegis, <seg
              rend="subscript">734</seg> she let her woven robe [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >peplos</foreign>] slip off at the threshold of her father, [735] her pattern-woven

            Zeus who has the aegis. <seg rend="subscript">743</seg> On her head she put the helmet,
            with a horn on each side and with four bosses, <seg rend="subscript">744</seg> golden,
            adorned with pictures showing the warriors [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pruleis</foreign>]
            of a hundred cities. [745] Into the fiery chariot with her feet she stepped, and she
            took hold of the spear, <seg rend="subscript">746</seg> heavy, huge, massive. With it
            she subdues the battle-rows of men— <seg rend="subscript">747</seg> heroes against whom
            she is angry, she of the mighty father. Hera lashed the horses on, and the gates of the
            sky bellowed as they flew open of their own accord, gates over which the Seasons
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Hōrai</foreign>] preside, [750] in whose hands are Heaven
            and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through
            these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Kronos sitting all
            alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. [755] There Hera of the white arms stayed her
            horses, and spoke to Zeus the son of Kronos, lord of all. “Father Zeus,” said she, “are
            you not angry with Arēs for these high doings? How great and goodly an army of the
            Achaeans he has destroyed to my great grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>],
            and without either right or reason [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>], [760]
            while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this
            unrighteous madman on to keep on doing things that are not right [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>]. I hope, Father Zeus, that you will not be angry if
            I hit Arēs hard, and chase him out of the battle.” </p>
          <p>And Zeus answered, [765] “Set Athena on to him, for she punishes him more often than
            any one else does.” </p>
          <p>Hera of the white arms did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward
            nothing loath midway betwixt earth and sky. [770] As far as a man can see when he looks
            out upon the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] from some high beacon, so
            far can the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they reached
            Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simoeis and Skamandros meet, [775]
            there Hera of the white arms stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid them in
            a thick cloud, and Simoeis made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; <seg
              rend="subscript">778</seg> and they [= the goddesses Hera and Athena] went along, like
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">homoiai</foreign>] tremulous doves, the way they went, <seg
              rend="subscript">779</seg> eager to protect the Argive men. [780] When they came to
            the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomedes,
            breaker of horses, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,
            there Hera stood still and raised a shout [785] like that of high-hearted brazen-voiced
            Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. “Argives,” she cried;
            “shame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] on cowardly creatures, brave in
            semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, his spear was so deadly [790] that the
            Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but now they come out far
            from the city and fight even at your ships.” </p>
          <p>With these words she put heart and spirit into them all, while owl-vision Athena sprang
            to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot and horses, [795]
            cooling the wound that Pandaros had given him. For the sweat caused by the hand that
            bore the weight of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he
            was lifting up the strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke
            of his horses and said, [800] “The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father.
            Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray even when I
            told him not to do so. When he went all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among
            the Kadmeians, [805] I bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that
            high spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the Kadmeians,
            and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help him. I stand by
            you too to protect you, [810] and I bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but
            either you are tired out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say
            that you are no true son of Tydeus, the son of high-spirited Oineus.” </p>
          <p>Powerful Diomedes answered, [815] “I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,
            and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor is there any
            slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions; you told me not to fight any
            of the blessed gods; [820] but if Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite came into battle I was to
            wound her with my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather
            in this place, for I know that Arēs is now lording it in the field.” </p>
          <p>[825] “Diomedes, son of Tydeus,” replied owl-vision goddess Athena, “man after my own
            heart, fear neither Arēs nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you. No,
            drive straight at violent Arēs, [830] and smite him in close combat; fear not this
            raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on the other. But now he
            was holding talk with Hera and myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the
            Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.”</p>
          <p>[835] With this she caught hold of Sthenelos and lifted him off the chariot on to the
            ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the goddess mounted the car and
            placed herself by the side of radiant Diomedes. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the
            burden of the terrifying goddess and the hero; [840] Pallas Athena took the whip and
            reins, and drove straight at Arēs. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, shining
            son of Okhesios and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Arēs was stripping him of his
            armor, and Athena [845] donned the helmet of Hādēs, that he might not see her; when,
            therefore, he saw Diomedes, breaker of horses, he made straight for him and let Periphas
            lie where he had fallen. [850] As soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with
            his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomedes’ life, but
            owl-vision Athena caught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the
            chariot. [855] Diomedes of the great war cry then threw, and Pallas Athena drove the
            spear into the pit of the stomach of brazen Arēs, where his under-belt went round him.
            There Diomedes wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again.
            Arēs roared [860] as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the
            Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrifying was the cry he raised. </p>
          <p>As a dark cloud in the sky [865] when it comes on to blow after heat, even so did
            Diomedes, son of Tydeus, see Arēs the brazen ascend into the broad sky. With all speed
            he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain sat down beside Zeus the
            son of Kronos, grieving in his spirit. [870] He showed Zeus the immortal blood that was
            flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying, “Father Zeus, are you not angered
            by such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one
            another’s hands while performing service [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] to
            mortals; [875] and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad termagant of a
            daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as
            you bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; [880] you encourage her because the
            pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomedes son of
            Tydeus to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and
            wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too, equal [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>]. [885] Had I not run for it I must either have lain there for long
            enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or have been eaten alive with spears till
            I had no more strength left in me.” </p>
          <p>Zeus looked angrily at him and said, “Do not come whining here, you who face both ways.
            [890] I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you are ever fighting and making
            mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Hera: it is all I
            can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: [895] still,
            I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was
            by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any other
            god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have been lying lower than the
            Titans.” </p>
          <p>He then bade Paieon heal him, [900] whereon Paieon spread pain-killing herbs upon his
            wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mold. As the juice of the fig-tree curdles
            milk, and thickens it in a moment though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paieon cure
            fierce Arēs. [905] Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took
            his seat by his father great Zeus all glorious to behold. </p>
          <p>But Hera of Argos and Athena of Alalkomene, now that they had put a stop to the
            murderous doings of Arēs, went back again to the house of Zeus.</p>

          <p rend="no-indent">[1] The fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it
            would, and the tide of war surged here and there over the plain as they aimed their
            bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams of Simoeis and Xanthos.</p>
          <p>[5] First, Ajax, son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke a phalanx of
            the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades by killing Akamas, son of
            Eussoros, the best man among the Thracians, being both brave and of great stature. The
            spear struck the projecting peak of his helmet: [10] its bronze point then went through
            his forehead into the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes. </p>
          <p>Then Diomedes killed Axylos, son of Teuthranos, a rich man who lived in the
            strong-founded city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a house by the
            roadside, [15] and entertained every one who passed; howbeit not one of his guests stood
            before him to save his life, and Diomedes killed both him and his attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] Kalesios, who was then his charioteer—so the pair
            passed beneath the earth.</p>
          <p>[20] Euryalos killed Dresos and Opheltios, and then went in pursuit of Aisepos and
            Pedasos, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble Boukolion. Boukolion was
            eldest son to haughty Laomedon, but he was a bastard. [25] While tending his sheep he
            had converse with the nymph, and she conceived twin sons; these the son of Mekisteus now
            slew, and he stripped the armor from their shoulders. Polypoites then killed Astyalos,
            [30] Odysseus Pidytes of Perkote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ableros fell by the spear of
            Nestor’s son Antilokhos, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatos who dwelt in Pedasos
            by the banks of the river Satnioeis. [35] Leitos killed Phylakos as he was fleeing, and
            Eurypylos slew Melanthos. </p>
          <p>Then Menelaos of the loud war-cry took Adrastos alive, for his horses ran into a
            tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain, [40] and broke the pole from
            the car; they went on towards the city along with the others in full flight, but
            Adrastos rolled out, and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot;
            Menelaos came up to him spear in hand, [45] but Adrastos caught him by the knees begging
            for his life. “Take me alive,” he cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall have a full
            ransom for me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron
            laid by in his house. From this store he will give you a large ransom [50] should he
            hear of my being alive and at the ships of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he plead, and Menelaos was for yielding and giving him to a attendant
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] to take to the ships of the Achaeans,
            but Agamemnon came running up to him and rebuked him. [55] “My good Menelaos,” said he,
            “this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well at the hands of
            the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them—not even the child unborn and in its
            mother’s womb; let not a man of them be left alive, [60] but let all in Ilion perish,
            unheeded and forgotten.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words were just.
            Menelaos, therefore, thrust Adrastos from him, whereon powerful King Agamemnon struck
            him in the flank, and he fell: then the son of Atreus [65] planted his foot upon his
            breast to draw his spear from the body.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, “My friends, Danaan warriors,
            attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, let no man lag that
            he may spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships. [70] Let us kill as many
            as we can; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later at your
            leisure.” </p>
          <p>With these words he put heart and spirit into them all. And now the Trojans would have
            been routed and driven back into Ilion, [75] had not Priam’s son Helenos, wisest of
            augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas, “Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] of the Trojans and Lycians, for you are
            foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel; [80] hold your ground here, and go
            about among the army of warriors to rally them in front of the gates, or they will fling
            themselves into the arms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you
            have put heart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight the Danaans
            [85] however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be done. Meanwhile do you,
            Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what is happening. Tell her to bid the
            matrons gather at the temple of owl-vision Athena in the acropolis; let her then take
            her key and open the doors of the sacred building. [90] The peplos that seems to her to
            have the most pleasurable beauty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] and is the
              biggest <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> in the palace—the one that is by far the most
            near and dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] to her— <seg rend="subscript"
              >92</seg> she must take that one and lay it on the knees of Athena with the beautiful
            hair. Let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never
            yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess, if she will take pity [95] on the town,
            with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus the wild
            spear-fighter from falling on the goodly city of Ilion; for he fights with fury and
            fills men’s spirits with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even
            their great champion Achilles, [100] son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man:
            his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in prowess.”</p>
          <p>Hector did as his brother bade him. <seg rend="subscript">103</seg> Straightaway he [=
            Hector] leapt out of his chariot, armor and all, hitting the ground, and went about
            everywhere among the army of warriors, brandishing his spears, [105] urging the men on
            to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the
            Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased their murderous onset, for they thought that some
            one of the immortals had come down from the starry sky to help the Trojans, so strangely
            had they rallied. [110] And Hector shouted to the Trojans, “High-hearted Trojans and
            far-renowned allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I go to
            Ilion and tell the old men of our council and our wives [115] to pray to the gods
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimones</foreign>] and vow hecatombs in their honor.” </p>
          <p>With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round his shield beat
            against his neck and his ankles. </p>
          <p>Then Glaukos, son of Hippolokhos, and the son of Tydeus [120] went into the open space
            between the armies to fight in single combat. When they were close up to one another
            Diomedes of the loud war-cry was the first to speak. “Who, my good sir,” said he, “who
            are you among men? I have never seen you in battle until now, [125] but you are daring
            beyond all others if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face my might.
            If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come down from the sky, I will not
            fight you; [130] for even valiant Lykourgos, son of Dryas, did not live long when he
            took to fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in
            charge of frenzied Dionysus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsoi on
            the ground as manslaughtering Lykourgos [135] beat them with his oxgoad. Dionysus
            himself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to her bosom to
            comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the man reviled him. Then the gods
            who live at ease were angry with Lykourgos and the son of Kronos struck him blind, nor
            did he live much longer [140] after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore I
            will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit of the
            ground, draw near and meet your doom.” </p>
          <p>And the shining son of Hippolokhos answered, [145] Son of Tydeus, you with the
              great <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>! Why do you ask about my lineage
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">genēē</foreign>]? <seg rend="subscript"
              >146</seg> The <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">genēē</foreign> of men is like the <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">genēē</foreign> of leaves. <seg rend="subscript">147</seg> Some leaves
            are shed on the earth by the wind, <seg rend="subscript">148</seg> while others are
            grown by the greening forest—and the season [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrā</foreign>] of

              >genēē</foreign> of men: one grows, another wilts. [150] If, then, you would learn my
            descent, it is one that is well known to many. There is a city in the heart of Argos,
            pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of
            all humankind. He was the son of Aiolos, and had a son named Glaukos, [155] who was
            father to Bellerophon the blameless, whom the gods have endowed with the most surpassing
            comeliness and beauty. But Proitos devised his ruin, and being stronger than he, drove
            him from the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of the Argives, over
            which Zeus had made him ruler. [160] For beautiful Antaia, wife of Proitos, lusted after
            him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honorable man
            and would not, so she told lies about him to Proitos. ‘Proitos,’ said she, ‘kill
            Bellerophon or die, [165] for he would have had converse with me against my will.’ The
            king was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia bearing
            baneful signs [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign> pl.], written inside a folded
            tablet and containing much ill against the bearer. [170] He bade Bellerophon show these
            written signs to his father-in-law, to the end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon
            therefore went to Lycia, and the gods escorted him safely. </p>
          <p>When he reached the river Xanthos, which is in Lycia, the king received him with all
            goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine heifers in his honor, [175] but when
            rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see
            the markings [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign> pl.] from his son-in-law Proitos.
            When he had received the baneful markings [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign> pl.]
            he first commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, [180] who was
            not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lion and the tail of a
            serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she breathed forth flames of fire; but
            Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided by divine signs. He next fought the far-famed
            Solymoi, [185] and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed
            the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning thence the king
            devised yet another plan for his destruction; he selected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >krinein</foreign>] the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade,
            but not a man ever came back, [190] for blameless Bellerophon killed every one of them.
            Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, so he kept him in
            Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honor [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him
            a piece of land, [195] the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled
            fields, to have and to hold. </p>
          <p>The king’s daughter bore valiant Bellerophon three children, Isandros, Hippolokhos, and
            Laodameia. Zeus, the lord of counsel, lay with Laodameia, and she bore him noble
            Sarpedon; [200] but when Bellerophon came to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all
            desolate and dismayed upon the plain of Alea, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the
            path of man. Arēs, insatiate of battle, killed his son Isandros while he was fighting
            the glorious Solymoi; [205] his daughter was killed by Artemis of the golden reins, for
            she was angered with her; but Hippolokhos was father to myself, and when he sent me to
            Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outcompete my
            peers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers [210] who were the noblest in Ephyra
            and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomedes of the great war cry was glad. He planted
            his spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. [215] “Then,” he said,
            “you are an old friend of my father’s house. Great Oineus once entertained Bellerophon
            the blameless for twenty days, and the two exchanged presents. Oineus gave a belt rich
            with purple, [220] and Bellerophon a double cup, which I left at home when I set out for
            Troy. I do not remember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child, when
            the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I must be
            your host in middle Argos, [225] and you mine in Lycia, if I should ever go to that
            locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]; let us avoid one another’s spears
            even during a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies whom I can
            kill, if I overtake them and the gods deliver them into my hand; so again with yourself,
            there are many Achaeans whose lives you may take if you can; [230] we two, then, will
            exchange armor, that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.” </p>
          <p>With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another’s hands, and
            plighted friendship. But Zeus, the son of Kronos, made Glaukos take leave of his wits,
            [235] for he exchanged golden armor for bronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle
            for the worth of nine. </p>
          <p>Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives and daughters of
            the Trojans came running towards him to ask after their sons, brothers, kinsmen, [240]
            and husbands: he told them to set about praying to the gods, and many were made
            sorrowful as they heard him. </p>
          <p>Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with colonnades of hewn
            stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers—all of hewn stone— [245] built near one
            another, where the sons of Priam slept, each with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on
            the other side the courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for
            Priam’s daughters, built near one another, [250] where his sons-in-law slept with their
            wives. When Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodike, the fairest
            of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said, “My son, why have you left
            the battle to come here? [255] Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard
            about the city that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Zeus from the
            citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may make offering to Zeus and to the
            other immortals, [260] and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh
            strength when he is wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of your
            kinsmen.” </p>
          <p>And tall Hector of the shining helmet answered, “Honored mother, bring no wine, [265]
            lest you unman me and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to Zeus
            with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may not pray to the son
            of Kronos. Get the matrons together, [270] and go with offerings to the temple of Athena
            driver of the spoil; <seg rend="subscript">271</seg> The peplos, whichever is for you
            the one that has the most pleasurable beauty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>]
            and is the biggest <seg rend="subscript">272</seg> in the palace—the one that is by far
            the most near and dear [philos] to you yourself— <seg rend="subscript">273</seg> take
            that one and lay it on the knees of Athena with the beautiful hair. Promise, moreover,
            to sacrifice twelve yearling heifers [275] that have never yet felt the goad, in the
            temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones
            of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from off the goodly city of Ilion, for he
            fights with fury, and fills men’s spirits with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Athena,
            [280] while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth
            might open her jaws and swallow him, for Zeus bred him to be the bane of the Trojans,
            and of high-hearted Priam and Priam’s sons. Could I but see him go down into the house
            of Hādēs, [285] my heart would forget its heaviness.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">286</seg> So he [= Hector] spoke, and she [= Hecuba], going into
            the palace, summoned her handmaidens, <seg rend="subscript">287</seg> calling out to
            them. And they went around the city to assemble the highborn women. <seg
              rend="subscript">288</seg> Meanwhile she descended into the fragrant
              storechamber. <seg rend="subscript">289</seg> There they were, the peploi, completely
            pattern-woven [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">poikiloi</foreign>], the work of women, [290]
            from Sidon, whom Alexandros [= Paris] himself, the godlike, <seg rend="subscript"
              >291</seg> had brought home [to Troy] from the land of Sidon, sailing over the vast
            sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">292</seg> on that
            journey when he brought also Helen, genuine daughter of the Father. <seg
              rend="subscript">293</seg> Hecuba lifted out one and brought it as gift to
              Athena, <seg rend="subscript">294</seg> the one that was the most beautiful in
            pattern-weavings [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">poikilmata</foreign>] and the biggest, [295]
            and it shone like a star. It lay beneath the others. <seg rend="subscript">296</seg> She
            went on her way, and the many highborn women hastened to follow her. <seg
              rend="subscript">297</seg> When these [women] had come to Athena’s temple at the top
            of the citadel, <seg rend="subscript">298</seg> Theano of the fair cheeks opened the
            door for them, <seg rend="subscript">299</seg> daughter of Kissēs and wife of Antenor,
            breaker of horses, [300] she whom the Trojans had established to be priestess of the
            Athenian goddess. <seg rend="subscript">301</seg> With a cry of ololu! all lifted up
            their hands to Athena, <seg rend="subscript">302</seg> and Theano of the fair cheeks,
            taking up the peplos, laid it <seg rend="subscript">303</seg> along the knees of Athena
            the lovely-haired, and praying <seg rend="subscript">304</seg> she supplicated the
            daughter of powerful Zeus: [305] “O Lady Athena, our city’s defender, shining among
              goddesses: <seg rend="subscript">306</seg> break the spear of Diomedes, and grant that
            the man be <seg rend="subscript">307</seg> hurled on his face in front of the Scaean
            Gates; so may we <seg rend="subscript">308</seg> instantly dedicate within your shrine
            twelve heifers, <seg rend="subscript">309</seg> yearlings, never broken, if only you
            will have pity [310] on the city of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent
            children.” Thus she prayed, but Pallas Athena granted not her prayer. </p>
          <p>While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Zeus, Hector went to the fair
            house of Alexandros, which he had had built for him [315] by the foremost builders in
            the land. They had built him his house, storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam
            and Hector on the acropolis. Here Hector, beloved of Zeus, entered, with a spear eleven
            cubits long in his hand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, [320] and was
            fastened to the shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandros within the
            house, busied about his armor, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow;
            there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their several tasks; [325] and
            as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of scorn. “Sir,” said he, “you do ill to
            nurse this rancor; the people perish fighting round this our town; you would yourself
            chide one [330] whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or before long
            the city will be in a blaze.” </p>
          <p>And godlike Alexandros answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore, and
            believe me when I tell you that [335] I am not here so much through rancor or ill-will
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nemesis</foreign>] towards the Trojans, as from a desire to
            indulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold it better
            that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. [340] Wait, then, while I put on my armor,
            or go first and I will follow. I shall be sure to overtake you.” </p>
          <p>Hector of the shining helmet made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. “Brother,”
            said she, “to my abhorred and sinful self, [345] would that a whirlwind had caught me up
            on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some mountain or to the waves
            of the roaring sea that should have swept me away before this mischief had come about.
            But, since the gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, [350] that I had been
            wife to a better man—to one who could smart under dishonor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >nemesis</foreign>] and men’s evil speeches. This man was never yet to be depended
            upon, nor never will be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother, come
            in and rest upon this seat, [355] for it is you who bear the brunt of that toil
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] that has been caused by my hateful self and
            by the derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] of Alexandros—whom Zeus has
              doomed <seg rend="subscript">357</seg> so that even in the future <seg
              rend="subscript">358</seg> we will be subjects of song for men yet to be.” </p>
          <p>And tall Hector of the shining helmet answered, [360] “Bid me not be seated, Helen, for
            all the goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, who miss
            me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and of his own self also let
            him make haste to overtake me before I am out of the city. [365] I must go home to see
            my household, my wife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever again
            return to them, or whether the gods will cause me to fall by the hands of the
            Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>Then Hector of the shining helmet left her, [370] and right away was at his own house.
            He did not find Andromache of the white arms, for she was on the wall with her child and
            one of her maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, [375] he
            stood on the threshold of the women’s rooms and said, “Women, tell me, and tell me true,
            where did Andromache go when she left the house? Was it to my sisters, or to my
            brothers’ wives? or is she at the temple of Athena [380] where the other women are
            propitiating the terrifying goddess?”</p>
          <p>His good housekeeper answered, “Hector, since you bid me tell you things that are true
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">alēthea</foreign>], she did not go to your sisters nor to
            your brothers’ wives, nor yet to the temple of Athena, [385] where the other women are
            propitiating the terrifying goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilion, for she had
            heard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were in great force:
            she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse went with her carrying the
            child.”</p>
          <p>[390] Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went down the
            streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone through the city and had
            reached the Scaean gates through which he would go out on to the plain, his wife came
            running towards him, [395] Andromache, daughter of great Eëtion who ruled in Thebe under
            the wooded slopes of wooded Mount Plakos, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter
            had married Hector of the bronze helmet, and now came to meet him with a nurse who
            carried [400] his little child in her bosom—a mere babe. Hector’s darling son, and
            lovely as a star. <seg rend="subscript">402</seg> Hector used to call him Skamandrios,
            but the others <seg rend="subscript">403</seg> called him Astyanax; for Hector alone
            protected Ilion. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, [405]
            and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. <seg
              rend="subscript">407</seg> “What’s gotten into you [Hector]—some kind of superhuman

            I know well in my thinking, in my heart, that <seg rend="subscript">448</seg> there will
            come a day when, once it comes, the sacred city of Ilios [= Ilion = Troy] will be
              destroyed <seg rend="subscript">449</seg> —and Priam, too, and along with him [will be
            destroyed] the people of that man with the fine ash spear, that Priam. [450] But the
            pain I have on my mind is not as great for the Trojans and for what will happen to them
            in the future, <seg rend="subscript">451</seg> or for Hecuba or for Priam the king, <seg
              rend="subscript">452</seg> or for my brothers if, many in number and noble as they
              are, <seg rend="subscript">453</seg> they will fall in the dust at the hands of men
            who are their enemies <seg rend="subscript">454</seg> —no, [the pain I have on my mind
            is not as great for them] as it is for you when I think of a moment when some Achaean
            man, one of those men who wear khitons of bronze, [455] takes hold of you as you weep
            and leads you away as his prize, depriving you of your days of freedom from
              slavery. <seg rend="subscript">456</seg> And you would be going to Argos, where you
            would be weaving [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">huphainein</foreign>] at the loom of some
            other woman [and no longer at your own loom at home] <seg rend="subscript"
            >457</seg> —and you would be carrying water for her, drawing from the spring called
            Messēís or the one called Hypereia. <seg rend="subscript">458</seg> Again and again you
            will be forced to do things against your will, and the bondage holding you down will be
              harsh. <seg rend="subscript">459</seg> And someone some day will look at you as you
            pour out your tears and will say: [460] “Hector is the man whose wife this woman used to
            be. He used to be the best in battle <seg rend="subscript">461</seg> —the best of all
            the Trojans, those horse-tamers, back in those days when they fought to defend Ilion [=
              Troy].” <seg rend="subscript">462</seg> That is what someone some day will say. And
            just hearing it will give you a new sorrow <seg rend="subscript">463</seg> as the widow
            of this kind of man, the kind that is able to prevent those days of slavery. <seg
              rend="subscript">464</seg> But, once I am dead, may earth be scattered over me and
            cover me, [465] before I hear your cry as they carry you into bondage.” </p>
          <p>He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled in his nurse’s
            bosom, scared at the sight of his father’s armor, [470] and at the horse-hair plume that
            nodded fiercely from his helmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but glorious
            Hector took the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he
            took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, [475] praying over him
            the while to Zeus and to all the gods. “Zeus,” he cried, “grant that this my child may
            be even as myself, chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent in strength,
            and let him rule Ilion with his might. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle,
            ‘The son is far better than the father.’ [480] May he bring back the bloodstained spoils
            of him whom he has laid low, and let his mother’s heart be glad.’” </p>
          <p>With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took him to her own soft
            bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband watched her his heart yearned towards
            her [485] and he caressed her fondly, saying, “My own wife, do not take these things too
            bitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hādēs before my time, but if a man’s hour
            is come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when he has once been
            born. [490] But you go back to the household and attend to your own work, <seg
              rend="subscript">491</seg> that is, the loom and the shuttle, giving orders to the
            handmaidens [who work for you]. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself with your
            daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is
            man’s matter, and mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilion.” </p>
          <p>He took his plumed helmet from the ground, [495] and his wife went back again to her
              house; <seg rend="subscript">496</seg>she was turning her head back again and again,
            shedding tears thick and fast. When she reached her home she found her maidens within,
            and bade them all join in her lament; [500] so they mourned Hector, slayer of men, in
            his own house though he was yet alive, for they thought that they should never see him
            return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armor overlaid with
            bronze, [505] and hastened through the city as fast as his feet could take him. As a
            horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place
            where he is wont to bathe in the fair-flowing river—he holds his head high, and his mane
            streams [510] upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind to
            the haunts and feeding ground of the mares—even so went forth Paris the son of Priam
            from high Pergamon, gleaming like sunlight in his armor, and he laughed aloud as he sped
            swiftly on his way. [515] Right away he came upon his brother, radiant Hector, who was
            then turning away from the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he was
            himself the first to speak. “Sir,” said he, “I fear that I have kept you waiting when
            you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.” </p>
          <p>[520] “My good brother,” answered tall Hector of the shining helmet, “you fight
            bravely, and no man with any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you
            are careless and willfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear the ill that the
            Trojans speak about you, [525] for they went through much toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right
            hereafter, should Zeus grant that we offer to the eternal gods of the sky the cup of our
            deliverance in our own homes, when we have chased the strong-greaved Achaeans from
            Troy.”</p>
        </div>
        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 7</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] With these words Hector, the glorious, passed through the gates,
            and his brother Alexandros with him, both eager for the fray. As when some god sends [5]
            a breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have labored at their oars
            till they are faint with toil, even so welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the
            Trojans. </p>
          <p>Then Alexandros killed Menesthios, the son of Arēithoös; he lived in Ame, and was son
            of Arēithoös [10] the Mace-man, and of ox-vision Phylomedousa. Hector threw a spear at
            Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.
            Glaukos, moreover, son of Hippolokhos, chief of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight
            smote Iphinoos, [15] son of Dexios, on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his
            chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life
            left in him. </p>
          <p>When, therefore, owl-vision Athena saw these men making havoc of the Argives, she
            darted down to Ilion [20] from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was looking on
            from Pergamon, went out to meet her; for he wanted the Trojans to be victorious. The
            pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo son of Zeus was first to speak. “What would
            you have,” said he, “daughter of great Zeus, [25] that your proud spirit has sent you
            here from Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline the scales
            of victory in favor of the Danaans? Let me persuade you—for it will be better thus—stay
            the combat for today, [30] but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass the
            doom of Ilion, since you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.” </p>
          <p>And owl-vision goddess Athena answered, “So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind [35]
            that I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, how do you
            propose to end this present fighting?” </p>
          <p>Apollo, son of Zeus, replied, “Let us incite great Hector, breaker of horses, to
            challenge some one of the Danaans [40] in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be
            shamed into finding a man who will fight him.” </p>
          <p>Owl-vision Athena assented, and Helenos, son of Priam, [45] divined the counsel of the
            gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, “Hector, son of Priam, peer of gods in
            counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans
            all of them take their seats, [50] and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet
            you in single combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of
            your doom is not yet come.” </p>
          <p>Hector was glad when he heard this saying, [55] and went in among the Trojans, grasping
            his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they all sat down. Agamemnon also bade
            the strong-greaved Achaeans be seated. But Athena and the lord of the silver bow,
            Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, [60] perched on father Zeus’ high oak tree, proud
            of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together, bristling with shield and helmet
            and spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the sea [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] and the waters grow dark beneath it, [65] so sat the
            companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector spoke thus: </p>
          <p>“Hear me, Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;
            Zeus, son of Kronos, on his high throne has brought our oaths [70] and covenants to
            nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of Troy, or
            are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the Achaeans are here present in
            the midst of you; let him, then, that will fight me [75] stand forward as your champion
            against radiant Hector. Thus I say, and may Zeus be witness between us. If your champion
            slay me, let him strip me of my armor and take it to your ships, but let him send my
            body home that the Trojans [80] and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am
            dead. In like manner, if Apollo grant me glory and I slay your champion, I will strip
            him of his armor and take it to the city of Ilion, where I will hang it in the temple of
            far-striking Apollo. <seg rend="subscript">84</seg> And I will give back his corpse,
            sending it back to their ships with the sturdy benches, [85] so that the Achaeans, they
            with their long hair, may ritually prepare [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >tarkhuein</foreign>] him <seg rend="subscript">86</seg> and that they may pile up for
            him a tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] on the shore of the expansive
              Hellespont. <seg rend="subscript">87</seg> And some day, someone from a future
            generation will say, <seg rend="subscript">88</seg> as he is sailing on a many-benched
            ship over the wine-dark sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>]: <seg
              rend="subscript">89</seg> “This is the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>]
            of a man who died a long time ago, [90] who was performing his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aristeiā</foreign> when illustrious Hektor killed him.” <seg rend="subscript"
              >91</seg> That is what someone will say, and my fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>] will never perish.”</p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline the challenge, yet
            fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaos rose and rebuked them, [95] for he was
            angry. “Alas,” he cried, “vain braggarts, women not men, double-dyed indeed will be the
            stain upon us if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every man
            of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless [100] and inglorious in your places. I
            will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight will be from on high in
            the hands of the immortal gods.” </p>
          <p>With these words he put on his armor. <seg rend="subscript">104</seg> At that point,
            Menelaos, the end of your life would have appeared, [105] in the clutches of Hector,
            since he was better by far, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you and
            checked you. Powerful King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said, “Menelaos,
            you are mad; [110] a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of passion, do not think
            of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector, son of Priam, who is feared
            by many another as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more mighty than you are,
            shrank from meeting him in battle. [115] Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will
            send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I
            bet his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of
            this fight.”</p>
          <p>[120] With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, whereon his
            attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] gladly stripped the armor
            from off his shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, “Truly,” said he, “the Achaean land
            is fallen upon grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]. [125] The old
            charioteer Peleus, counselor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his
            house to question me concerning the birth and lineage of all the Argives. How would it
            not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? [130] Many a time
            would he lift his hands in prayer that his spirit might leave his body and go down
            within the house of Hādēs. Would, by father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I were still
            young and strong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid
            river Celadon [135] under the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river
              Iardanos. <seg rend="subscript">136</seg> Their champion stood forth, Ereuthalion, a
            man godlike, <seg rend="subscript">137</seg> wearing upon his shoulders the armor of
            King Arēithoös, <seg rend="subscript">138</seg> Arēithoös the brilliant, named the Club
              Bearer <seg rend="subscript">139</seg> by the men and fair-girdled women of that time,
            [140] because he fought not with bow and arrows, nor with a long spear, <seg
              rend="subscript">141</seg> but with a club coated with iron he smashed the army
              ranks. <seg rend="subscript">142</seg> Lykourgos killed him—with a stratagem, not with
            power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kratos</foreign>] — <seg rend="subscript">143</seg> in a
            narrow pass, where the iron club could not ward off <seg rend="subscript">144</seg> his
            destruction, since Lykourgos anticipated him [145] by pinning him through the middle
            with his spear, and he fell down backwards to the ground. <seg rend="subscript"
              >146</seg> And he stripped off the armor that brazen Arēs had given him. <seg
              rend="subscript">147</seg> And from then on he wore the armor himself whenever he went
            to the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mōlos</foreign>] of Arēs. <seg
              rend="subscript">148</seg> But when Lykourgos was growing old in his halls, <seg
              rend="subscript">149</seg> he gave it to Ereuthalion to wear, his near-and-dear
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign>]. [150] So, wearing his armor [of Arēithoös], he [Ereuthalion] was
            challenging all the best to fight him. <seg rend="subscript">151</seg> But they were all
            afraid and trembling: no one undertook to do it. <seg rend="subscript">152</seg> I was
            the only one, driven to fight by my heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>]
            which was ready to undertake much, <seg rend="subscript">153</seg> with all its
            boldness, even though I was the youngest of them all. <seg rend="subscript">154</seg> I
            fought him, and Athena gave me fame. [155] For I killed the biggest and the best
              man: <seg rend="subscript">156</seg> he sprawled in his great bulk from here to
              here. <seg rend="subscript">157</seg> If only I were that young! If only my <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign> had remained as it was! For the son of Priam would then
            soon find one who would face him. But you, foremost among the whole army of warriors
            though you be, [160] have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector.” </p>
          <p>Thus did the old man rebuke them, and right away nine men started to their feet.
            Foremost of all stood the lord of men, King Agamemnon, and after him brave Diomedes, the
            son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in valor as with a garment, [165]
            and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his manslaughtering brother in arms. After these
            Eurypylos, glorious son of Euaimon, Thoas, the son of Andraimon, and Odysseus also rose.
            [170] Then Nestor charioteer of Gerenia again spoke, saying: “Cast lots among you to see
            who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will have done good service
            alike to his own spirit and to the strong-greaved Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[175] Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown it into
            the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their hands in prayer, and thus
            would one of them say as he looked into the vault of the sky, “Father Zeus, grant that
            the lot fall on Ajax, [180] or on Diomedes, the strong son of Tydeus, or upon the king
            of rich Mycenae himself.” </p>
          <p>As they were speaking, Nestor charioteer of Gerenia shook the helmet, and from it there
            fell the very lot which they wanted—the lot of Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed
            it to all the chieftains of the Achaeans, going from left to right; [185] but they none
            of them owned it. When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon
            it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him
            the lot. When Ajax saw his mark [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] he knew it and
            was glad; [190] he threw it to the ground and said, “My friends, the lot is mine, and I
            rejoice, for I shall vanquish radiant Hector. I will put on my armor; meanwhile, pray to
            King Zeus [195] in silence among yourselves that the Trojans may not hear you—or aloud
            if you will, for we fear no man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning,
            for I was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.”</p>
          <p>[200] With this they fell praying to King Zeus, the son of Kronos, and thus would one
            of them say as he looked toward the vault of the sky, “Father Zeus that rules from Ida,
            most glorious in power, grant victory to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you
            wish well to Hector also and would protect him, [205] grant to each of them equal fame
            and prowess.” </p>
          <p>Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze. When he was in
            full array he sprang forward as monstrous as Arēs the war god when he takes part among
            men whom Zeus [210] has set fighting with one another—even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of
            the Achaeans, spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long
            spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans
            [215] trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat quickly, but he could
            not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had been the challenger.
            Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like a wall— [220] a shield of bronze
            with seven folds of ox-hide—the work of Tykhios, who lived in Hyle and was by far the
            best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls, and over
            these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this shield before him, [225] Ajax,
            son of Telamon, came close up to Hector, and menaced him saying, “Hector, you shall now
            learn, man to man, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides
            lion-hearted Achilles, cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships [230] in
            anger with Agamemnon, shepherd of his people, but there are many of us who are well able
            to face you; therefore begin the fight.”</p>
          <p>And tall Hector of the glancing helmet answered, “Noble Ajax, son of Telamon and seed
            of Zeus, chief of the army of warriors, [235] treat me not as though I were some puny
            boy or woman that cannot fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of
            battle. I am quick to turn my leather shield either to right or left, for this I deem
            the main thing in battle. [240] I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, and in
            hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Arēs; howbeit I would not take such a man
            as you are off his guard—but I will smite you openly if I can.” </p>
          <p>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. [245] It struck the sevenfold
            shield in its outermost layer—the eighth, which was of bronze—and went through six of
            the layers but in the seventh hide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, [250] and
            struck the round shield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his
            gleaming shield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it
            pierced the khiton against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life. [255] They
            then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another like
            savage lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the
            middle of Ajax’s shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was
            turned. [260] Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear went
            through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed his neck
            and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he
            drew back, and with his strong hand seized a stone [265] that was lying on the
            plain—great and rugged and black; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on the boss
            that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far
            larger stone, swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. [270] This millstone
            of a rock broke Hector’s shield inwards and threw him down on his back with the shield
            crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Then they would have hacked at one
            another in close combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men,
            [275] come forward, one from the Trojans and the other from the bronze-armored
            Achaeans—Talthybios and Idaios both of them honorable men; these parted them with their
            staves, and the good herald Idaios said, “My sons, fight no longer, [280] you are both
            of you valiant, and both are dear to Zeus who gathers clouds; we know this; but night is
            now falling, and the requests of night may not be well ignored.” </p>
          <p>Ajax son of Telamon answered, “Idaios, bid Hector say so, [285] for it was he that
            challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept his saying.” </p>
          <p>Then tall Hector of the glancing helmet said, “Ajax, the gods have granted you stature
            and strength, and judgment; and in wielding the spear you excel all others of the
            Achaeans. [290] Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will fight anew till
            some superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] decides between us,
            and give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and the requests of night
            may not be well ignored. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships, [295]
            and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I, in the great city
            of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie with one another in
            their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presents [300] that it may be
            said among the Achaeans and Trojans, ‘They fought with might and main, but were
            reconciled and parted in friendship.’</p>
          <p>Then he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and well-cut baldric, [305]
            and in return Ajax gave him a belt dyed with purple. Thus they parted, the one going to
            the army of the Achaeans, and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they
            saw their hero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax.
            [310] They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond their
            hopes. On the other side the strong-greaved Achaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to
            Agamemnon. </p>
          <p>When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed for them
            [315] a five-year-old bull in honor of Zeus the all-powerful son of Kronos. They flayed
            the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints; these they cut carefully up into
            smaller pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing
            them off. <seg rend="subscript">319</seg> But when they finished with their efforts and
            prepared the feast [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>] [320] they feasted [= had
              the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>], and there was no <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign> lacking in a fair allotment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dais</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">321–322</seg> And wide-ruling Agamemnon the
            hero, son of Atreus, gave as honorifc portion [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>]
            to Ajax the whole back [of beef]. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, [325]
            old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with all sincerity and
            goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus: </p>
          <p>“Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the flowing-haired Achaeans
            are now dead, whose blood Arēs has shed by the banks of the Skamandros, [330] and their
            spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhai</foreign>] have gone down to the house of
            Hādēs, it will be well when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then
            wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the ships, that
            when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades home [335] to their children.
            Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a tomb that shall be raised from the plain for
            all in common; near this let us set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and
            our ships, and let it have well-made gates [340] that there may be a way through them
            for our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to keep off both
            horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and the princes shouted in approval. [345] Meanwhile the Trojans held a
            council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by the gates of King Priam’s
            palace; and high-spirited Antenor spoke. “Hear me,” he said, “Trojans, Dardanians, and
            allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. [350] Let us give up Argive Helen and her
            wealth to the sons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn
            covenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.” </p>
          <p>He then sat down [355] and radiant Alexandros husband of lovely-haired Helen rose to
            speak. “Antenor,” said he, “your words are not to my liking; you can find a better
            saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in good earnest, [360] then
            indeed have the gods robbed you of your reason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify
            to the Trojans that I will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home
            with her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my own.” </p>
          <p>[365] Then, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the lineage of Dardanos,
            peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:
            “Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. [370]
            Get your suppers now as before throughout the city, but keep your watches and be
            wakeful. At daybreak let Idaios go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaos sons of
            Atreus the saying of Alexandros through whom this quarrel has come about; [375] and let
            him also be instant with them that they now cease fighting till we burn our dead;
            hereafter we will fight anew, till some superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] decides between us and give victory to one or to the other.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. [380] They took supper in their
            companies and at daybreak Idaios went his way to the ships. He found the Danaans,
            attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, in council at the
            stern of Agamemnon’s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. [385] “Son of
            Atreus,” he said, “and princes of the Achaean army of warriors, Priam and the other
            noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandros through whom this
            quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it acceptable. All the treasure he
            took with him [390] in his ships to Troy—would that he had sooner perished—he will
            restore, and will add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of
            glorious Menelaos, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire
            further [395] if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight
            anew, till some superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] decide
            between us and give victory to one or to the other.” </p>
          <p>They all held their peace, but presently Diomedes of the loud war cry spoke, saying,
            [400] “Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet Helen, for even a child may see
            that the doom of the Trojans is at hand.” The sons of the Achaeans shouted approval at
            the words that Diomedes, breaker of horses, had spoken, [405] and then King Agamemnon
            said to Idaios, “Idaios, you have heard the answer the Achaeans make you—and I with
            them. But as concerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, [410] for when men are
            once dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Zeus, the
            high-thundering husband of Hera, be witness to this covenant.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he upheld his scepter in the sight of all the gods, and Idaios went back to
            the strong city of Ilion. The Trojans and Dardanians were gathered [415] in council
            waiting his return; when he came, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As
            soon as they heard it they set about their twofold labor, some to gather the corpses,
            and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from their ships,
            [420] some to gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood. </p>
          <p>The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the celestial vault
            from the slow still currents of deep Okeanos, when the two armies met. They could hardly
            recognize their dead, [425] but they washed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears
            over them, and lifted them upon their wagons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail
            aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having burned
            them went back to the city of Ilion. [430] The strong-greaved Achaeans in like manner
            heaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went back to
            their ships. </p>
          <p>Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the Achaeans were
            gathered round the pyre [435] and built one tomb that was raised in common for all, and
            hard by this they built a high wall to shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it
            strong gates that there might be a way through them for their chariots, [440] and close
            outside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with stakes. </p>
          <p>Thus did the flowing-haired Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Zeus the
            lord of lightning, marveled at their great work; [445] but Poseidon, lord of the
            earthquake, spoke, saying, “Father Zeus, what mortal in the whole world will again take
            the gods into his counsel [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]? See you not how the
            Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench [450] all round it,
            without offering hecatombs to the gods? The fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>] of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no
            longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much
            labor for Laomedon.” </p>
          <p>Zeus who gathers clouds was displeased and answered, [455] “What, O shaker of the
            earth, are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed at what
            they are doing, but your fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] reaches as far
            as the light of dawn spreads. Surely when the flowing-haired Achaeans [460] have gone
            home with their ships, you can shatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can
            cover the beach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly
            effaced.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse, and by sunset [465] the work of the Achaeans was completed;
            they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their supper. Many ships had come with
            wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of
            Jason freighted them with ten thousand measures of wine, [470] which he sent specially
            to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos. From this supply the flowing-haired
            Achaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with
            whole heifers, [475] and some again with captives. They spread a goodly banquet and
            feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans and their allies in the city.
            But all the time Zeus boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear
            got hold upon them, [480] and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,
            nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of Kronos. Then
            they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. </p>

          <head>Rhapsody 8</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now when Dawn, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse
            light over the earth, Zeus called the gods in council on the topmost crest of serrated
            Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave ear. [5] “Hear me,” said he, “gods
            and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor
            god try to cross me, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an
            end. [10] If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall
            be beaten inordinately before he comes back again to Olympus; or I will hurl him down
            into dark Tartaros far into the deepest pit under [15] the earth, where the gates are
            iron and the floor bronze, as far beneath Hādēs as the sky is high above the earth, that
            you may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for
              yourselves. <seg rend="subscript">19</seg> Hang a golden cord from the sky and hold on
            to it, [20] all you gods and goddesses. <seg rend="subscript">21</seg> But still you
            could not pull Zeus, the supreme counsellor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēstō</foreign>],
            from the sky to the ground, <seg rend="subscript">22</seg> even if you tried very
              hard. <seg rend="subscript">23</seg> But when I feel like it and decide to pull, <seg
              rend="subscript">24</seg> I could pull all the way, earth and all, sea and all. [25]
            Then I would tie the cord around a ridge of Olympus <seg rend="subscript">26</seg> and
            then everything would be in mid-air. <seg rend="subscript">27</seg> That is how much
            superior I am to gods and men.” </p>
          <p>They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had spoken
            masterfully; [30] but at last owl-vision Athena answered, “Father, son of Kronos, king
            of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid, but we are also sorry for
            the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and coming to a bad end. [35] We will, however,
            since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable
            suggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in your
            displeasure.” </p>
          <p>Zeus, the gatherer of clouds, smiled at her and answered, “Take heart, my child,
            Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, [40] and I wish to be kind to you.” </p>
          <p>With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hooves of bronze and manes of glittering
            gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body, seized his gold whip and took his
            seat in his chariot. Then [45] he lashed his horses and they flew forward without
            hesitation midway between earth and starry sky. After a while he reached Ida with its
            many fountains, mother of wild beasts, and Gargaros, where are his grove and fragrant
            altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses, [50] took them from the
            chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the
            topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>The flowing-haired Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and
            afterwards put on their armor. The Trojans [55] on the other hand likewise armed
            themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless eager perforce to do
            battle for their wives and children. All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and
            foot rushed forth with the tramp as of a great multitude.</p>
          <p>[60] When they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield, and spear
            with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was the din as the bossed shields
            pressed hard on one another—cry and shout of triumph [65] of slain and slayers, and the
            earth ran red with blood. </p>
          <p>Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons beat against one
            another, and the people fell, but when the sun had reached the mid-point of the sky, the
            father of all balanced his golden scales, [70] and put two fates of death within them,
            one for the Trojans, breakers of horses, and the other for the bronze-armored Achaeans.
            He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans
            sank; the death-fraught scale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground, while that
            of the Trojans rose toward the sky. [75] Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the
            glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them
            and they were mightily afraid. </p>
          <p>Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes, attendants
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, hold their ground. [80]
            Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own
            will, but one of his horses was disabled. Radiant Alexandros, husband of lovely-haired
            Helen, had hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to
            grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. [85] The horse bounded in his anguish as
            the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The old man
            instantly began cutting the traces with his sword, but Hector’s fleet horses bore down
            upon him through the rout with their bold charioteer, [90] even Hector himself, and the
            old man would have perished there and then had not Diomedes been quick to mark, and with
            a loud cry called Odysseus to help him. </p>
          <p>“Resourceful Odysseus,” he cried, “noble son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, where are you
            fleeing to, with your back turned like a coward? [95] See that you are not struck with a
            spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor from this man’s
            furious onset.” </p>
          <p>Long-suffering great Odysseus would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the
            Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick of the fight [100]
            took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. “Sir,” said he, “these young
            warriors are pressing you hard, your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your
            attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] is naught, and your horses are
            slow to move. [105] Mount my chariot and see what the horses of Tros can do—how cleverly
            they can scud here and there over the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them
            from the hero Aeneas. Let our attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theraponte</foreign>]
            attend to your own steeds, but [110] let us drive straight at the Trojans, breakers of
            horses, that Hector may learn how furiously I too can wield my spear.” </p>
          <p>Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, hearkened to his words. Then the two mighty attendants
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theraponte</foreign>], Sthenelos and kind-hearted Eurymedon,
            saw to Nestor’s horses, [115] while the two both mounted Diomedes’ chariot. Nestor took
            the reins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with Hector,
            and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging full speed towards them.
            He missed him, but struck his charioteer and attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign>] [120] Eniopeus, son of noble Thebaios, in the breast by the
            nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he lost his life-breath [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] there and then, and the horses swerved as he fell
            headlong from the chariot. [125] Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his
            charioteer, but let him lie for all his sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >akhos</foreign>], while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds have to
            go long without one, for he presently found brave Arkheptolemos, the bold son of
            Iphitos, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.</p>
          <p>[130] All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been penned up in
            Ilion like sheep, had not the father of gods and men been quick to mark, and hurled a
            fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just in front of Diomedes’ horses [135] with a
            flare of burning brimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath the
            car, while the reins dropped from Nestor’s hands. Then he was afraid and said to
            Diomedes, “Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; [140] see you not that the hand of
            Zeus, son of Kronos, is against you? Today he grants victory to Hector; tomorrow, if it
            so please him, he will again grant it to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart
            the purpose [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Zeus, for he is far stronger
            than any.”</p>
          <p>[145] Diomedes of the great war cry answered, “All that you have said is true; there is
            a grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] however which pierces me to the very
            heart, for Hector will talk among the Trojans and say, ‘The son of Tydeus fled before me
            to the ships.’ [150] This is the boast he will make, and may earth then swallow me.”</p>
          <p>“Son of brave Tydeus,” replied Nestor, “what mean you? Though Hector say that you are a
            coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, [155] nor yet the wives of the
            mighty warriors whom you have laid low.” </p>
          <p>So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle, and with a cry
            that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their darts after them. [160] Tall
            Hector of the shining helmet shouted to him and said, “Son of Tydeus, the Danaans have
            done you honor before now as regards your place at table, the meals they give you, and
            the filling of your cup with wine. Henceforth they will despise you, for you are become
            no better than a woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our
            walls [165] through any hesitation on my part; neither shall you carry off our wives in
            your ships, for I shall give you with my own hand the fate [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] of death.” </p>
          <p>The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or not to turn his horses round again and
            fight him. Thrice did he doubt, [170] and three times did Zeus thunder from the heights
            of Ida as a sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] to the Trojans that he would
            turn the battle in their favor. Hector then shouted to them and said, “Trojans, Lycians,
            and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, my friends, and fight with might and
            with main; [175] I see that Zeus is minded to grant victory and great glory to myself,
            while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building
            this weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly
            over their trench, [180] but when I get to the hollow ships <seg rend="subscript"
              >181</seg> let there be some memory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mnēmosunē</foreign>], in
            the future, of the burning fire, <seg rend="subscript">182</seg> how I will set the
            ships on fire and kill <seg rend="subscript">183</seg> the Argives [= Achaeans] right by
            their ships, confounded as they will be by the smoke.” </p>
          <p>Then he cried to his horses, [185] “Xanthos and Podargos, and you Aithon and goodly
            Lampos, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet wheat with which
            Andromache, daughter of high-hearted Eëtion, has fed you, and for she has mixed wine and
            water for you to drink whenever you would, before doing so [190] even for me who am her
            own husband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] of which ascends to the sky, for it is of solid gold,
            arm-rods and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomedes, breaker of
            horses, [195] the cuirass which Hephaistos made him. Could we take these two things, the
            Achaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he boast, but Queen Hera made high Olympus quake as she shook with rage upon
            her throne. [200] Then said she to the mighty god of Poseidon, “What now, wide ruling
            lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans,
            who bring you many a welcome offering to Helike and to Aigai? Wish them well then. [205]
            If all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Zeus of
            the broad brows from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on
            Ida.” </p>
          <p>King Poseidon was greatly troubled and answered, “Hera, rash of tongue, what are you
            talking about? [210] We other gods must not set ourselves against Zeus son of Kronos,
            for he is far stronger than we are.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, from the ships even
            to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, who were [215] pent up there by Hector
            son of Priam, now that the hand of Zeus was with him. He would even have set fire to the
            ships and burned them, had not Queen Hera put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir
            himself and to encourage the Achaeans. [220] To this end he went round the ships and
            tents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull of
            Odysseus’ ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from this place that his voice would
            carry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, [225] and on
            the other towards those of Achilles—for these two heroes, well assured of their own
            strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. From this
            spot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans,
              saying, <seg rend="subscript">228</seg> “Shame, Argives! Though splendid in
            appearance, you are base objects of blame. <seg rend="subscript">228</seg> Where have
            the boasts gone, when we said that we are the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aristoi</foreign>]? [230] These boasts you uttered, saying empty words, at
              Lemnos, <seg rend="subscript">231</seg> when you were eating the abundant meat of
            straight-horned oxen <seg rend="subscript">232</seg> and drinking from great bowls
            filled to the brim with wine, <seg rend="subscript">233</seg> how any one of you could
            each stand up against a hundred or even two hundred Trojans <seg rend="subscript"
              >234</seg> in battle. But now we cannot even match one of them, [235] Hector, who is
            about to set fire to our ships with burning fire. Father Zeus, did you ever bring such
            ruin [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] to a great king and rob him so utterly of
            his greatness? Yet, when to my sorrow I was coming here, I never let my ship pass [240]
            your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one of them,
            so eager was I to destroy the strong-walled city of Troy. Grant me then this
            prayer—allow us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so
            utterly vanquished by the Trojans.”</p>
          <p>[245] Thus did he pray, and father Zeus pitying his tears granted that his people
            should live, not die; right away he sent them an eagle, most unfailingly portentous of
            all birds, with a young fawn in its talons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar
            [250] on which the Achaeans sacrificed to Zeus, the lord of omens. When, therefore, the
            people saw that the bird had come from Zeus, they sprang more fiercely upon the Trojans
            and fought more boldly. </p>
          <p>There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that he had driven his
            horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner than the son of Tydeus; [255] long
            before any one else could do so he slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaos, the
            son of Phradmon. He had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the
            back midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, [260] and his armor
            rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot. </p>
          <p>After him came Agamemnon and Menelaos, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes clothed in valor
            as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in arms Meriones, peer of manslaughtering
            Arēs, [265] and Eurypylos, the brave son of Euaimon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and
            took his place under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his
            shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, [270] the man
            would fall dead; then Teucer would hasten back to Ajax as a child to its mother, and
            again duck down under his shield. </p>
          <p>Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilokhos, and then Ormenos and
            Ophelestes, [275] Daitor, Khromios, and godlike Lykophontes, Amopaon, son of Polyaimon,
            and Melanippos. These in turn did he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon the lord
            of men was glad when he saw him making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. [280]
            He went up to him and said, “Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, chief among
            the army of warriors, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory
            of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when
            you were a child, bastard though you were. [285] Cover him with glory though he is far
            off; I will promise and I will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Zeus and Athena grant
            me to destroy the city of Ilion, you shall have the next best prize [290] of honor after
            my own—a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go up into your
            bed.”</p>
          <p>[292] And Teucer the blameless answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge
            me; from the moment we began to drive them back to strong-founded citadel of Ilion, I
            have never ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and kill; I
            have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried in the flesh of warlike
            youths, but I cannot hit this mad dog, with his wolfish rage [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >lyssa</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>[300] As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was bent on hitting
            him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit Priam’s brave son Gorgythion the
            blameless in the breast. [305] His mother, fair Kastianeira, lovely as a goddess, had
            been married from Aisyme, and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when
            it is weighed down by showers in spring—even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the
            weight of his helmet.</p>
          <p>[310] Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again his arrow
            missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector’s brave charioteer Arkheptolemos
            in the breast, by the nipple, as he was driving furiously into the fight. The horses
            swerved aside as he fell headlong from the chariot, [315] and there was no life
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] left in him. Hector was greatly grieved at
            the loss of his charioteer, but for all his sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>] he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother Kebriones, who
            was hard by, take the reins. Kebriones did as he had said. [320] Hector then with a loud
            cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great stone made straight for
            Teucer with intent kill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid
            it upon the bow-string, but shining-helmed Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he
            was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him just where the
            collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, [325] a very deadly place, and broke the
            sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he
            fell forward on his knees. Ajax [330] saw that his brother had fallen, and running
            towards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty
            attendants, Mekisteus, son of Ekhios, and radiant Alastor, came up and bore him to the
            ships groaning in his great pain.</p>
          <p>[335] Zeus now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans to their
            deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As a hound grips a wild boar or
            lion in [340] flank or buttock when he gives him chase, and watches warily for his
            wheeling, even so did Hector follow close upon the flowing-haired Achaeans, ever killing
            the hindmost as they rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set
            stakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans, [345]
            they halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying every man instantly as
            they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that,
            his eyes glaring like those of Gorgo or manslaughtering Arēs.</p>
          <p>[350] Hera, the goddess of the white arms, when she saw them had pity upon them, and at
            once said to Athena, “Alas, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, shall you and I take no more
            thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? See how they
            perish [355] and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single man. Hector the son
            of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has already done great mischief.” </p>
          <p>Owl-vision Athena answered, “Would, indeed, this man might die in his own land, and
            fall by the hands of the Achaeans; [360] but my father Zeus is mad with spleen, ever
            foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets how often I saved his son when he was
            worn out by the labors [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthloi</foreign>] Eurystheus had laid
            on him. He would weep till his cry came up to the sky, [365] and then Zeus would send me
            down to help him; if I had had the sense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him
            to the house of Hādēs, to fetch the infernal hound from Erebos, he would never have come
            back alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. [370] And now Zeus hates me, while
            he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and took hold of his beard,
            when she was begging him to do honor to Achilles, ransacker of cities. I shall know what
            to do next time he begins calling me his owl-vision darling. Get our horses ready, [375]
            while I go within the house of aegis-bearing Zeus and put on my armor; we shall then
            find out whether Priam’s son Hector of the shining helmet will be glad to meet us in the
            highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures [380] with the
            fat of their flesh as they be dead by the ships of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>Thus did she speak and white-armed Hera, exalted goddess and daughter of great Kronos,
            obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds, while Athena
            daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus [385] flung her richly vesture, made with her own hands,
            on to the threshold of her father, and donned the khiton of Zeus who gathers clouds,
            arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the
            spear [390] so stout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the ranks of heroes who
            have displeased her. Hera lashed her horses, and the gates of the sky bellowed as they
            flew open of their own accord—gates over which the Seasons [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hōrai</foreign>] preside, in whose hands are the sky and Olympus, either [395] to
            open the dense cloud that hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove
            their obedient steeds. </p>
          <p>But father Zeus when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent golden-winged Iris
            with a message to them. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, turn them back, and see that they do
            not come near me, [400] for if we come to fighting there will be mischief. This is what
            I say, and this is what I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl
            them from their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten years to
            heal [405] the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; my owl-vision daughter will
            then learn what quarrelling with her father means. I am less surprised and angry with
            Hera, for whatever I say she always contradicts me.”</p>
          <p>With this storm-footed Iris went her way, [410] fleet as the wind, from the heights of
            Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the outer gates of its
            many valleys and gave them her message. “What,” said she, “are you about? Are you mad?
            The son of Kronos forbids going. [415] This is what he says, and this is he means to do,
            he will lame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it
            in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning will inflict
            upon you, that [420] you may learn, owl-vision goddess, what quarrelling with your
            father means. He is less hurt and angry with Hera, for whatever he says she always
            contradicts him but you, bold hussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in
            defiance of Zeus?”</p>
          <p>[425] With this she left them, and Hera said to Athena, “Truly, child of aegis-bearing
            Zeus, I am not for fighting men’s battles further in defiance of Zeus. Let them live or
            die as luck [430] will have it, and let Zeus mete out his judgments upon the Trojans and
            Danaans according to his own pleasure.” </p>
          <p>She turned her steeds; the Seasons [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Hōrai</foreign>] presently
            unyoked them, made them fast to their ambrosial mangers, [435] and leaned the chariot
            against the end wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden
            thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry. </p>
          <p>Presently father Zeus drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the assembly of gods.
            [440] The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses for him, set the car upon its
            stand, and threw a cloth over it. Zeus of the wide brows then sat down upon his golden
            throne and Olympus reeled beneath him. Athena and Hera sat alone, apart [445] from Zeus,
            and neither spoke nor asked him questions, but Zeus knew what they meant, and said,
            “Athena and Hera, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many of your
            dear friends the Trojans? [450] Be this as it may, such is the might of my hands that
            all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both of you trembling all over before
            ever you saw the fight and its terrible doings. I tell you therefore—and it would have
            surely been— [455] I should have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never
            have brought you back again to Olympus.” </p>
          <p>Athena and Hera groaned in spirit as they sat side-by-side and brooded mischief for the
            Trojans. Athena sat silent without a word, for she was in a [460] furious passion and
            bitterly incensed against her father; but Hera could not contain herself and said,
            “What, dread son of Kronos, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,
            nevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors [465] who are perishing and
            coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from actual
            fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives, that they may not all
            of them perish in your displeasure.” </p>
          <p>And Zeus who gathers clouds answered, [470] “Tomorrow morning, ox-vision Hera, if you
            choose to do so, you will see the son of Kronos destroying large numbers of the Argives,
            for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the swift-footed son of
            Peleus [475] when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships’ sterns about the
            body of fallen Patroklos. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed; for all I care, you
            may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>], where Iapetos and Kronos dwell [480] in lone Tartaros with neither
            ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till you get there,
            and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you are the greatest vixen
            living.” </p>
          <p>Hera of the white arms made him no answer. [485] The sun’s glorious orb now sank into
            Okeanos and drew down night over the grain-giving land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans
            when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall upon the
            Achaeans. </p>
          <p>Then glorious Hector led the Trojans [490] back from the ships, and held a council on
            the open space near the river, where there was a spot clear of corpses. They left their
            chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech he made them. He grasped a spear
            eleven cubits long, [495] the bronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the
            ring round the spearhead was of gold. Spear in hand he spoke. “Hear me,” said he,
            “Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I thought but now that I should destroy the ships and
            all the Achaeans with them before I went back to Ilion, [500] but darkness came on too
            soon. It was this alone that saved them and their ships upon the seashore. Now,
            therefore, let us obey the behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses
            out of their chariots and give them their feeds of wheat; [505] then make speed to bring
            sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and wheat for your horses and gather
            much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose flare may reach to the
            sky. [510] For the flowing-haired Achaeans may try to flee beyond the sea by night, and
            they must not embark unscathed and unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart
            with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is [515] leaping on board his
            ship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the
            heralds tell it about the city that the growing youths and gray-bearded men are to camp
            upon its divinely built walls. [520] Let the women each of them light a great fire in
            her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by surprise while the
            army of warriors is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this
            suffice for the moment; [525] at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to
            Zeus and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for
            ‘tis the fates that have borne them and their ships here. This night, therefore, let us
            keep watch, but with [530] early morning let us put on our armor and rouse fierce war at
            the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomedes the son of Tydeus
            will drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and
            carry off his bloodstained spoils. [535] Tomorrow let him show his mettle [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>], abide my spear if he dare. I bet that at break of
            day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of his comrades round
              him. <seg rend="subscript">538</seg> If only I were <seg rend="subscript"
            >539</seg> immortal and unaging for all days to come, [540] and if only I were honored
              [=got <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] just as Athena and Apollo are honored
              [=get <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">541</seg> —as
            surely as this day brings misfortune to the Argives.”</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted approval. They took their sweating steeds
            from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his own chariot. [545] They made haste
            to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they brought wine also and wheat from their
            houses and gathered much wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals,
            and the wind carried the [550] sweet savor of sacrifice to the gods—but the blessed gods
            did not partake of it, for they bitterly hated Ilion with Priam of the strong ash spear
            and Priam’s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong night by the
            highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. [555] As when the stars shine
            clear, and the moon is bright—there is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor
            jutting headland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks forth from the
            sky; the stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad— [560] even
            thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilion midway between the ships and the
            river Xanthos. A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each
            there sat fifty men, while the horses, champing [565] oats and wheat beside their
            chariots, waited till dawn should come.</p>
        </div>
        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 9</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of bloodstained
            Rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all of them in despair.
            As when the two winds [5] that blow from Thrace—the north and the northwest—spring up of
            a sudden and rouse the fury of the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>]—in a
            moment the dark waves rear up their heads and scatter their sea-wrack in all
            directions—even thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>The son of Atreus in dismay [10] bade the heralds call the people to a council man by
            man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste also himself to call them, and they
            sat sorry at heart in their assembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream
            or cataract [15] on the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he
            spoke to the Achaeans. “My friends,” said he, “princes and councilors! Of the Argives,
            Zeus, son of Kronos, has tied me down with derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >atē</foreign>] more than anyone else. The cruel god gave me his solemn promise [20]
            that I should destroy the city of Troy before returning, but he has played me false, and
            is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is
            the will of Zeus, who has laid many a proud city in the dust [25] as he will yet lay
            others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say and sail back
            to our own country, for we shall not take Troy.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans [30] for a long while sat sorrowful there,
            but they all held their peace, till at last Diomedes of the loud battle-cry made answer
            saying, “Son of Atreus, I will chide your folly, as is my right [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] in council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do
            so. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and said that I was a
            coward and no warrior. The Argives young [35] and old know that you did so. But the son
            of scheming Kronos endowed you by halves only. He gave you honor as the chief ruler over
            us, but valor, which is the highest both right and might he did not give you. [40] Sir,
            think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and cowardly as you say
            they are? If your own mind is set upon going home—go—the way is open to you; the many
            ships that followed you from Mycenae stand ranged upon the seashore; [45] but the rest
            of us stay here till we have destroyed Troy. I tell you: though these too should turn
            homeward with their ships, Sthenelos and myself will still fight on till we reach the
            goal of Ilion, for the gods were with us when we came.”</p>
          <p>[50] The sons of the Achaeans shouted approval at the words of Diomedes, breaker of
            horses, and presently Nestor the charioteer rose to speak. “Son of Tydeus,” said he, “in
            war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are of your own
            years; [55] no one of the Achaeans can make light of what you say nor gainsay it, but
            you have not yet come to the end [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] of the whole
            matter. You are still young—you might be the youngest of my own children—still you have
            spoken wisely and have counseled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; [60]
            nevertheless I am older than you and I will tell you everything; therefore let no man,
            not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments civil discord is a
            clanless, hearthless outlaw. </p>
          <p>[65] Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers, but let the
            sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is without the wall. I am giving
            these instructions to the young men; when they have been attended to, do you, son of
            Atreus, give your orders, for you are the most royal among us all. [70] Prepare a feast
            for your councilors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so; there is
            abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace
            daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith to entertain guests, and you have
            many subjects. When many are got together, you can be guided by him whose [75] counsel
            is wisest—and sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his
            watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed? This night will either be
            the ruin of our army of warriors, or save it.”</p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. [80] The sentinels went out in
            their armor under command of Nestor’s son Thrasymedes, a chief of the army, and of the
            bold warriors Askalaphos and Ialmenos: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyros,
            and the son of Kreion, noble Lykomedes. [85] There were seven chiefs of the sentinels,
            and with each there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places
            midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had done so they lit their fires
            and got every man his supper. </p>
          <p>The son of Atreus then bade many councilors of the Achaeans [90] to his quarters and
            prepared a great feast in their honor. They laid their hands on the good things that
            were before them, and as soon as they had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose
            counsel was ever truest, was the first to lay his mind before them. [95] He, therefore,
            with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus. </p>
          <p>“With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, will I both begin my
            speech and end it, for you are king over many people. Zeus, moreover, has granted that
            you wield the scepter and uphold things that are right [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >themis</foreign>], that you may take thought for your people under you; [100]
            therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak and to give ear, and to turn
            into action the counsel of another who is minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and
            on your commands, therefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of a
            truer mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] than [105] that which has been mine
            from the hour when you angered Achilles by taking the girl Brisēis from his tent against
            my judgment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. I urged you not to do so, but you
            yielded to your own pride, [110] and dishonored a hero whom the gods themselves had
            honored—for you still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let us
            think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches that may conciliate
            him.” </p>
          <p>[115] And the lord of men, Agamemnon, answered, “You have reproved my derangement
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign> pl.] justly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom
            the gods befriend is in himself a host, and Zeus has shown that he befriends this man by
            destroying much people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my
            lesser mind; [120] therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts by way of
            atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all. I will give him seven tripods
            that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty
            iron cauldrons and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes.
            [125] Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses
            have won me. <seg rend="subscript">128</seg> And I will give seven women, skilled in
            flawless handiwork [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">erga</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
              >129</seg> women from Lesbos. These women, when Lesbos with all its beautiful
            settlements was captured by him [= Achilles] all by himself, [130] were chosen by me as
            my own share [of the war prizes], and in beauty they were winners over all other rival
            groups of women. <seg rend="subscript">131</seg> These are the women I will give him.
            And there will be among them the woman whom I took away back then, <seg rend="subscript"
              >132</seg>the daughter of Brisēs [= Brisēis]; and I swear a great oath that I never
            went up into her couch, nor have been with her after the manner [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] of men and women.</p>
          <p>[135] “All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the gods grant that
            I destroy the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and
            load his ship with gold and bronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan
            women, [140] the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos,
            wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honor with
            my own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters,
            [145] Khrysothemis, Laodike, and Iphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, freely
            and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no
            man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities, [150]
            Kardamyle, Enope, and Hirē, where there is grass; holy Pherai and the rich meadows of
            Anthea; lovely Aeipeia also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasos, all near the sea, and
            on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep;
            [155] they will honor him with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his
            comfortable ordinances [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign> pl.]. All this will I
            do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him then yield: it is only Hādēs who is utterly
            ruthless and unyielding—and hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to humankind.
            [160] Moreover I am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey
            me.” </p>
          <p>Then Nestor, the charioteer of Gerenia, answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of
            men, Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, [165] let us then send chosen
            messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. <seg
              rend="subscript">167</seg> But come, let those upon whom I am looking take on the
              task. <seg rend="subscript">167</seg> First of all, let Phoenix, dear to Zeus, take
            the lead; <seg rend="subscript">167</seg> and after him the great Ajax and brilliant
            Odysseus, [170] and of the heralds let Odios and Eurybates accompany them. Now bring
            water for our hands, and bid all keep silence while we pray to Zeus the son of Kronos,
            if so be that he may have mercy upon us.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants poured water over
            [175] the hands of the guests, while attendants filled the mixing-bowls with wine and
            water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering; then, when they
            had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set
            out from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; <seg rend="subscript">179</seg> And the
            Gerenian horseman Nestor gave them many instructions, [180] making signs with his eyes
            at each, especially at Odysseus, <seg rend="subscript">181</seg> that they try to
            persuade the blameless son of Peleus. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">182</seg> And the two went along the shore of the much-roaring
            sea, and prayed earnestly to earth-encircling Poseidon that the high spirit of the
            descendant of Aiakos might incline favorably towards them. [185] The two of them reached
            the shelters and the ships of the Myrmidons, <seg rend="subscript">186</seg> and they
            found Achilles diverting his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phrēn</foreign>] as he was
            playing on a clear-sounding lyre [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phorminx</foreign>], <seg
              rend="subscript">187</seg> a beautiful one, of exquisite workmanship, and its
            cross-bar was of silver. <seg rend="subscript">188</seg> It was part of the spoils that
            he had taken when he destroyed the city of Eëtion, <seg rend="subscript">189</seg> and
            he was now diverting his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] with it as he
            was singing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aeidein</foreign>] the glories of men [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">klea andrōn</foreign>]. [190] Patroklos was the only other person
            there. He [= Patroklos] sat in silence, facing him [= Achilles], <seg rend="subscript"
              >191</seg> and waiting for the Aeacid [= Achilles] to leave off singing [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aeidein</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">192</seg> Meanwhile the two
            of them came in—radiant Odysseus leading the way— <seg rend="subscript">193</seg> and
            stood before him. Achilles sprang up from his seat <seg rend="subscript">194</seg> with
            the lyre [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phorminx</foreign>] still in his hand, [195] and
            Patroklos, when he saw the guests, rose also. <seg rend="subscript">196</seg> Greeting
            the two of them, swift-footed Achilles said: <seg rend="subscript">197</seg> “Hail to
            the two of you: you have come as friends [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philoi</foreign>]. I
            need you very much— <seg rend="subscript">198</seg> you two who are the dearest [=
              most <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] to me among the Achaeans, even now
            when I am angry.”</p>
          <p>With this he led them forward, [200] and bade them sit on seats covered with purple
            rugs; then he said to Patroklos who was close by him, “Son of Menoitios, set a larger
            bowl upon the table, mix less water with the wine, and give every man his cup, for these
            are very dear friends, who are now under my roof.”</p>
          <p>[205] Patroklos did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in front of the
            fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin also of a goat, and the chine of a
            fat hog. Automedon held the meat while radiant Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the
            pieces and put them on spits while [210] the son of Menoitios made the fire burn high.
            When the flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top of them,
            lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and he sprinkled them with salt.
            [215] When the meat was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round the table
            in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat
            facing the godlike Odysseus against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroklos
            [220] offer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid
            their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough
            to eat and drink, <seg rend="subscript">223</seg> Ajax nodded to Phoenix; and brilliant
            Odysseus took note [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>], filled his cup with wine
            and pledged Achilles. </p>
          <p>[225] “Hail, Achilles! You will not be without a fair <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dais</foreign> <seg rend="subscript">226</seg> either in the tent of Agamemnon son of
              Atreus <seg rend="subscript">227</seg> or here and now. There is at hand much that
            would suit your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>, <seg rend="subscript"
              >228</seg> for you to have as <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>. But the concern

              >229</seg> Rather, we are facing a great pain [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >pēma</foreign>], O cherished-by-Zeus [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">diotrephēs</foreign>],
            [230] and we are in doubt. It can go either way, whether we can save or lose <seg
              rend="subscript">231</seg> the ships with their fair benches.  The Trojans and their
            allies have camped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires
            throughout their army of warriors and deem that nothing [235] can now prevent them from
            falling on our fleet. Zeus, moreover, has sent his signals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign> pl.] on their right; Hector, in all his glory, rages like a madman;
            confident that Zeus, son of Kronos, is with him he fears neither god nor man, but a
            wolfish rage [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">lyssa</foreign>] has entered him, [240] and he
            prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in
            pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and
            smothered in smoke; I much fear that the gods [245] will make good his boasting, and it
            will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then! And late
            though it be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before the fury of the
              Trojans. <seg rend="subscript">249</seg> You yourself will have an <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign> in the future, [250] and there will be no way to find
            a remedy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akos</foreign>] for the bad thing once it is
            done. Consider before it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction. </p>
          <p>My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon, did he not
            charge you saying, ‘Son, Athena and Hera will make you strong [255] if they choose, but
            check your high temper, for the better part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and
            the Achaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.’ These were his words,
            but you have forgotten them. Even now, [260] Stop! Abandon your anger, which causes pain
            for your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>. Agamemnon will make you great amends
            if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said in his tent that
            he will give you. He will give you seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire,
            and ten talents of gold; twenty [265] iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have
            won races and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as
            many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. [270] And he [= Agamemnon] will give
            seven women, skilled in flawless handiwork [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >erga</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">271</seg>women from Lesbos. These women, when
            Lesbos with all its beautiful settlements was captured by you [= Achilles] all by
              yourself, <seg rend="subscript">272</seg> were chosen by him as his own share [of the
            war prizes], and in beauty they were winners, back then, over all other rival groups of
              women. <seg rend="subscript">273</seg> These are the women that he will give you. And
            there will be among them the woman whom he took away back then, <seg rend="subscript"
              >274</seg> the daughter of Brisēs [= Brisēis]; and he will swear a great oath, [275]
            he has never gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] of men and women. All these things will he give you
            now down, and if hereafter the gods grant that he destroy the city of Priam, you can
            come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your ship with [280] gold and
            bronze to your liking. You can take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen
            herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his
            son-in-law, and he will show you like honor with his own dear son Orestes, [285] who is
            being nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters, Khrysothemis, Laodike,
            and Iphianassa; you may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,
            to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower [290] to boot as no man ever yet gave his
            daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities, Kardamyle, Enope, and Hirē
            where there is grass; holy Pherai and the rich meadows of Anthea; lovely Aipeia also,
            and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasos, [295] all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy
            Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honor you with
            gifts as if you were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign> pl.]. All this will he do if you will now forgo your
            anger. [300] Moreover, though you hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet
            pity the rest of the Achaeans who are being hard pressed as the whole army of warriors;
            they will honor you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You might
            even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, [305] for he has a wolfish rage
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">lyssa</foreign>] and declares that not a Danaan whom the
            ships have brought can hold his own against him.” </p>
          <p>Swift-footed Achilles answered, <seg rend="subscript">308</seg> “Descended from Zeus,
            son of Laertes, you of many resources, Odysseus: <seg rend="subscript">308</seg> I see
            that I must say what I say back to you without mincing words, [310] just the way I
            think, and the way it will be that the outcome has been reached [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">teleîn</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">311</seg> So do not try to
            cajole me, taking turns sitting down next to me. <seg rend="subscript">312</seg> Here is
            why. Hateful [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthros</foreign>] is that man to me, as hateful
            as the gates of Hādēs, <seg rend="subscript">313</seg> the man who hides one thing in
            his thinking and says another thing. <seg rend="subscript">314</seg> As for me, I will
            say it the way it seems best to me. [315] I will be appeased neither by Agamemnon son of
            Atreus nor by any other of the Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] for all my fighting. He that fights fares no better
            than he that does not; coward and hero are held in equal honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>], [320] and death deals like measure to him who works and him who is
            idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships—with my life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it to
            her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, [325] even so many a long night have I been
            wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day against those who were fighting
            for their women. With my ships I have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy
            have I stormed with my men by land; [330] I took great store of wealth from every one of
            them, but I gave all up to Agamemnon, son of Atreus. He stayed where he was by his
            ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept much himself. Nevertheless he
            did distribute some prizes of honor among the chieftains and kings, [335] and these have
            them still; from me alone of the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted—let
            him keep her and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives fight the Trojans? What
            made the son of Atreus gather the army of warriors and bring them? Was it not for the
            sake of Helen? [340] Are the only mortal men in the world who love their wives <seg
              rend="subscript">341</seg> the sons of Atreus? I ask this question because any man who
            is noble and sensible <seg rend="subscript">342</seg> loves [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >phileîn</foreign>] and cherishes her who is his own, just as I, with regard to her [=
              Brisēis] <seg rend="subscript">343</seg> with my whole heart did I love [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">phileîn</foreign>] her, though she was only the prize of my
            spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me false; [345] I know him; let
            him tempt me no further, for he shall not move me. <seg rend="subscript">346</seg> Let
            him, Odysseus, along with you <seg rend="subscript">347</seg> and the other kings devise
            a way to ward off the destructive fire from the ships. <seg rend="subscript"
            >348</seg> He has indeed labored greatly in my absence, <seg rend="subscript"
            >349</seg> and he has even built a wall and driven a ditch around it [350] —wide and big
            it is—and he has fastened stakes inside. <seg rend="subscript">351</seg> Even so he
            cannot hold back the strength of Hector the man-killer. So long as I fought the Achaeans
            Hector did not let the battle range far from the city walls; he would come to the Scaean
            gates and to the oak tree, but no further. [355] Once he stayed to meet me and hardly
            did he escape my onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will
            tomorrow offer sacrifice to Zeus and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the
            water and then victual them duly; tomorrow morning, if you care to look, you will see
            [360] my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might and main. If
            Poseidon the shaker of the earth grants me a fair passage, in three days I shall be in
            generous Phthia. I have much there that I left behind me when I came here [365] to my
            sorrow, and I shall bring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair
            women, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who
            gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you, [370] and tell him in
            public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of him should he think that he can yet
            dupe others for his effrontery never fails him. </p>
          <p>As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I will take no counsel
            with him, and will undertake nothing in common with him. [375] He has wronged me and
            deceived me enough, he shall not cozen me further; let him go his own way, for Zeus of
            the counsels has robbed him of his reason. His presents are hateful [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthra</foreign>] to me, and for him I care not a bit. He may offer
            me ten or even twenty times [380] what he has now done, or, more than that, all that he
            has in the world, both now and ever in the future. He may promise me the wealth of
            Orkhomenos or of Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world, for it
            has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may drive at once with their
            chariots and horses; [385] he may offer me gifts as many as the sands of the sea or the
            dust of the plain in multitude. But even so he shall not move me till I have been
            revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she
            may be fair as Aphrodite, [390] and skillful as owl-vision Athena, but I will have none
            of her: let another take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger
            kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife; [395] there
            are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have cities under them;
            of these I can take whom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in
            Phthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, [400] and to enjoy the
            riches of my old father Peleus. <seg rend="subscript">401</seg> My life [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] is worth more to me than all the wealth <seg
              rend="subscript">402</seg> that was once possessed, so they say, by that well-situated
            citadel of Ilion, <seg rend="subscript">403</seg> back when it was still at peace,
            before the coming of the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">404</seg> or than all the
            treasure that is stored inside when you enter the stone threshold of the one who shoots,
            [405] Phoebus Apollo, at rocky Pytho [= Delphi]. <seg rend="subscript">406</seg> Cattle
            and sheep can be rustled in a raid, <seg rend="subscript">407</seg> and one can acquire
            both tripods and horses with their golden manes if he wants them, <seg rend="subscript"
              >408</seg> but a man’s life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] can never come
            back—it cannot be rustled in a raid <seg rend="subscript">409</seg> and thus taken
            back—once it has passed through the barriers of his teeth.</p>
          <p>[410] My mother Thetis, goddess with silver steps, tells me that <seg rend="subscript"
              >411</seg> I carry the burden of two different fated ways [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kēres</foreign>] leading to the final moment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>] of death. <seg rend="subscript">412</seg> If I stay here and fight
            at the walls of the city of the Trojans, then my safe homecoming [<foreign

              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] that is imperishable [<foreign

            back home, returning to the dear land of my forefathers, [415] then it is my glory
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>], genuine [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >esthlon</foreign>] as it is, that will be destroyed for me, but my life force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aiōn</foreign>] will then <seg rend="subscript"
            >416</seg> last me a long time, and the final moment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>] of death will not be swift in catching up with me. To the rest of
            you, then, I say, ‘Go home, for you will not take Ilion.’ Zeus of the wide brows [420]
            has held his hand over her to protect her, and her people have taken heart. <seg
              rend="subscript">421</seg> But you must go back to the chieftains of the Achaeans <seg
              rend="subscript">422</seg> and give them this message—for that is the privilege of the
              Elders— <seg rend="subscript">423</seg> that they should devise in their thoughts
            another plan [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>] that is better <seg
              rend="subscript">424</seg> and that will rescue their ships and the host of the
            Achaeans [425] who are at the hollow ships. For this one [this <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mētis</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">426</seg> which they now devised during the
            time of my anger, does not suffice. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here that he may sail
            with me in the morning if he so will. But I will not take him by force.”</p>
          <p>[430] They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he had denied
            them, till presently the old charioteer Phoenix in his great fear for the ships of the
            Achaeans, burst into tears and said, “Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to have a
            return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>], [435] and in the fierceness of your
            anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son, can I remain here
            without you? Your father Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad from
            Phthia to Agamemnon. [440] You knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men
            make their mark in council, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence of
            speech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not [445] stay here without you—no, not
            even if the gods themselves grant me the gift of stripping my years from off me, and
            making me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land of fair women. I was then
            fleeing the anger of my father Amyntor, son of Ormenos, who was furious with me in the
            matter of his concubine, [450] of whom he was enamored to the wronging of his wife my
            mother. My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman myself,
            that so she hates my father, and in the course of time I yielded. But my father soon
            came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the dread Furies [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >Erinyes</foreign>] to witness. [455] He prayed that no son of mine might ever sit
            upon my knees—and the gods, Zeus of the world below and terrifying Persephone, fulfilled
            his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me think
            [460] on men’s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer of my father:
            nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father’s house with him so bitter against
            me. My cousins and clansmen came about me, [465] and pressed me sorely to remain; many a
            sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roast
            before the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father’s wine. [470] Nine whole
            nights did they set a guard over me taking turns to watch, and they kept a fire always
            burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court at the doors of
            the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, [475] I broke
            through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the outer court after
            passing quickly and unperceived through the men on guard and the women servants. I then
            fled through Hellas till I came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, [480] and to King
            Peleus, who made me welcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be
            heir to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people, establishing me on
            the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler over the Dolopians.</p>
          <p>[485] It was I, godlike Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all my
            heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone out elsewhere, till I had
            first set you upon my knees, cut up the dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the
            wine-cup to your lips. [490] Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby
            helplessness over my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that the gods
            had granted me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you, Achilles, [495] that in
            my hour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your pride and
            beat it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aretē</foreign>] and majesty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] of the gods
            are more than ours, [500] but even the gods may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he
            prays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries and by incense, with
            drink-offerings and the savor of burnt sacrifice. For Appeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >Litai</foreign>] are like daughters to great Zeus; lame, wrinkled, with eyes askance,
            they follow in the footsteps of the goddess Derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >Atē</foreign>]. [505] She, being fierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind
            him, and ever baneful to humankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but
            nevertheless the Appeals [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Litai</foreign>] come hobbling and
            healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters of Zeus when they draw near him,
            they will bless him and hear him too when he is making his own appeals; [510] but if he
            deny them and will not listen to them, they go to Zeus the son of Kronos and make an
            appeal to him that this man may presently fall into derangement [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>]—for him to regret bitterly hereafter. <seg
              rend="subscript">513</seg> So, Achilles, you too must grant that the Daughters of Zeus
              [= <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Litai</foreign>] be given their <seg rend="subscript"
              >514</seg> honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>], which makes flexible the
            thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of others, good as they are. [515]
            Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later—if he were
            still furious and implacable—I am not he that would bid you throw off your anger
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] and help the Achaeans, no matter how great
            their need; but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; [520] he has sent his chiefs
            to urge his suit, and has selected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] those
            who of all the Argives are most acceptable to you; make not then their words and their
            coming to be of no effect. Your anger has been righteous so far. <seg rend="subscript"
              >524</seg> This is how [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">houtōs</foreign>] we [= I, Phoenix]
            learned it, the glories [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">klea</foreign>] of men [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">andrōn</foreign>] of an earlier time [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >prosthen</foreign>], [525] who were heroes [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >hērōes</foreign>], whenever one of them was overcome by tempestuous anger. <seg
              rend="subscript">526</seg> They could be persuaded by way of gifts and could be swayed
            by words <seg rend="subscript">527</seg> I totally recall [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >me-mnē-mai</foreign>] how this was done—it happened a long time ago, it is not
            something new— <seg rend="subscript">528</seg> recalling exactly how it was. I will tell
            it in your company—since you are all near and dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >philoi</foreign>].</p>
          <p>The Kouretes and the steadfast Aetolians were fighting [530] and killing one another
            round Calydon—the Aetolians defending the city and the Kouretes trying to destroy it.
            For Artemis of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oineus had not
            offered [535] her his harvest first fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with
            hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Zeus alone he had made no sacrifice. He had
            forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Then
            the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him—a savage
            wild boar with great white tusks [540] that did much harm to his orchard lands,
            uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But Meleagros son
            of Oineus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities [545] and killed it—for it was so
            monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a man did it stretch upon the funeral
            pyre. Then the goddess set the Kouretes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about the
            head and skin of the boar.</p>
          <p>[550] So long as Meleagros, dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] to Arēs,
            was fighting in the war, <seg rend="subscript">551</seg> things went badly for the
            Kouretes [of the city of Pleuron], and they could not <seg rend="subscript"
            >552</seg> put up a resistance [against the Aetolians] outside the city walls [of
            Pleuron, the city of the Kouretes], even though they [= the Kouretes] had a multitude of
              fighters. <seg rend="subscript">553</seg> But as soon as anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kholos</foreign>] entered Meleagros—the kind of anger that affects
            also others, <seg rend="subscript">554</seg> making their thinking [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] swell to the point of bursting inside their chest even
            if at other times they have sound thoughts [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >phroneîn</foreign>], [555] [then things changed:] he [= Meleagros] was angry [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">khōomenos</foreign>] in his heart at his dear mother Althaea, <seg
              rend="subscript">556</seg> and he was lying around, next to his wife, whom he had
            courted and married in the proper way. She was the beautiful Kleopatra, <seg
              rend="subscript">557</seg> whose mother was Marpessa, the one with the beautiful
            ankles, daughter of Euenos, <seg rend="subscript">558</seg> and whose father was Idēs, a
            man most powerful among those earthbound men <seg rend="subscript">559</seg> who lived
            in those times. It was he [= Idēs] who had grabbed his bow and had stood up against the
            lord [560] Phoebus Apollo, and he [= Idēs] had done it for the sake of his bride
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">numphē</foreign>], the one with the beautiful ankles [=
              Marpessa]. <seg rend="subscript">561</seg> She [= Kleopatra] had been given a special
            name by the father and by the queen mother back then [when she was growing up] in the
              palace. <seg rend="subscript">562</seg> They called her Alcyone, making that a second
            name for her, because her <seg rend="subscript">563</seg> mother [= Marpessa] was
            feeling the same pain [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">oitos</foreign>] felt by the halcyon
            bird, known for her many sorrows [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]. <seg
              rend="subscript">564</seg> She [= Marpessa] was crying because she had been seized and
            carried away by the one who has far-reaching power, Phoebus Apollo. [565] So, right next
            to her [= Kleopatra], he [= Meleagros] lay down, nursing his anger [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kholos</foreign>]—an anger that brings pains [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >algea</foreign>] to the heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>]. <seg
              rend="subscript">566</seg> He was angry [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kholoûsthai</foreign>] about the curses [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ārai</foreign>]
            that had been made by his own mother. She [= Meleagros’s mother Althaea] had been
            praying to the gods, <seg rend="subscript">567</seg> making many curses [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ārâsthai</foreign>] in her sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>] over the killing of her brother [by her son Meleagros]. <seg
              rend="subscript">568</seg> Many times did she beat the earth, nourisher of many, with
            her hands, <seg rend="subscript">569</seg> calling upon Hādēs and on terrifying
            Persephone. [570] She had gone down on her knees and was sitting there; her chest and
            her lap were wet with tears <seg rend="subscript">571</seg> as she prayed that they [=
            the gods] should consign her son to death. And she was heard by a Fury [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">Erinys</foreign>] that roams in the mist, <seg rend="subscript"
              >572</seg> a Fury heard her, from down below in Erebos—with a heart that cannot be
            assuaged.</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">573</seg> And then it was that the din of battle rose up all
            around the gates [of the people of Calydon], and also the dull thump <seg
              rend="subscript">574</seg> of the battering against their walls. Now he [= Meleagros]
            was sought out by the elders [575] of the Aetolians [= the people of Calydon]; they were
            supplicating [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">lissesthai</foreign>] him, and they came along
            with the best priests of the gods. <seg rend="subscript">576</seg> They were
            supplicating him [= Meleagros] to come out [from where he was lying down with his wife]
            and rescue them from harm, promising him a big gift. <seg rend="subscript"
            >577</seg> They told him that, wherever the most fertile plain in the whole region of
            lovely Calydon may be, <seg rend="subscript">578</seg> at that place he could choose a
            most beautiful precinct [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">temenos</foreign>] of land, <seg
              rend="subscript">579</seg> fifty acres, half of which would be a vineyard [580] while
            the other half would be a field open for plowing. <seg rend="subscript">581</seg> He was
            also supplicated many times by the old charioteer Oineus, <seg rend="subscript"
              >582</seg> who was standing at the threshold of the chamber with the high ceiling <seg
              rend="subscript">583</seg> and beating at the locked double door, hoping to supplicate
            him by touching his knees. <seg rend="subscript">584</seg> Many times did his sisters
            and his mother the queen [585] supplicate [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >lissesthai</foreign>] him. But all the more did he say “no!” Many times did his
            comrades [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>] supplicate him, <seg
              rend="subscript">586</seg> those who were most cherished by him and were the most near
            and dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philoi</foreign>] of them all, <seg rend="subscript"
              >587</seg> but, try as they might, they could not persuade the heart [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] in his chest <seg rend="subscript">588</seg> —not
            until the moment when his chamber got a direct hit, and the walls of the high
              fortifications <seg rend="subscript">589</seg> were getting scaled by the Kouretes,
            who were starting to set fire to the great city [of Calydon]. [590] Then at long last
            Meleagros was addressed by his wife, who wears her waistband so beautifully around her
              waist. <seg rend="subscript">591</seg> She was crying as she supplicated [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">lissesthai</foreign>] him, telling everything in detail <seg
              rend="subscript">592</seg> —all the sorrowful things [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kēdea</foreign>] that happen to those mortals whose city is captured. <seg
              rend="subscript">593</seg> They kill the men. Fire turns the city to ashes. <seg
              rend="subscript">594</seg> They take away the children and the wives, who wear their
            waistbands so beautifully around their waists. [595] His heart was stirred when he heard
            what bad things will happen. <seg rend="subscript">596</seg> He got up and went off.
            Then he covered his body with shining armor. <seg rend="subscript">597</seg> And this is
            how [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">houtōs</foreign>] he rescued the Aetolians from the evil
            day [of destruction]. <seg rend="subscript">598</seg> He yielded to his heart [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>]. But they [= the Aetolians] no longer carried out
            the fulfillment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">teleîn</foreign>] of their offers of
              gifts <seg rend="subscript">599</seg>—those many pleasing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kharienta</foreign>] things that they had offered. But, in any case, he protected
            them from the evil event. [600] As for you [= Achilles], don’t go on thinking [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>] in your mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

              >602</seg> to try to rescue the ships [of the Achaeans] if they are set on fire. So,
            since the gifts are waiting for you, <seg rend="subscript">603</seg> get going! For if
            you do that, the Achaeans will honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīnein</foreign>]
            you—same as a god. <seg rend="subscript">604</seg> But if you have no gifts when you do
            go into the war, that destroyer of men, [605] you will no longer have honor [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] the same way, even if you have succeeded in blocking
            the [enemy’s] forces of war.”</p>
          <p>And Achilles of the swift feet answered, “Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no
            need of such honor. I have honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] from Zeus
            himself, which will abide with me at my ships while I have breath [610] in my body, and
            my limbs are strong. I say further—and lay my saying to your heart—vex me no more with
            this weeping and lamentation, all for the gratification [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kharis</foreign>] of the great son of Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the

          <p>[620] Then he nodded quietly to Patroklos as a sign that he was to prepare a bed for
            Phoenix, and that the others should make their return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

              >637</seg> feeling [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] have the gods put into
            your chest, and this, all because of just one girl, <seg rend="subscript">638</seg> just
            one, whereas we now offer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain. Be
            then of a more gracious mind, [640] respect the hospitality of your own roof. We are
            with you as messengers from the army of the Danaans, and would be held nearest and
            dearest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philtatoi</foreign>] to yourself of all the
            Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>“Ajax,” replied swift-footed Achilles, “noble son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, [645] you
            have spoken much to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember
            how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some vile tramp, and
            that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then, and deliver your message; [650] say
            that I will have no concern with fighting till Hector the radiant, son of noble Priam,
            reaches the tents of the Myrmidons <seg rend="subscript">653</seg> killing the Argives,
            and until he darkens with fire [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">katasmukhein</foreign>] our
            vessels. For all his lust of battle, I take it [655] he will be held in check when he is
            at my own tent and ship.”</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">656</seg> So he spoke, and they each took a double-handled
              cup <seg rend="subscript">657</seg> and made a libation; then they went back to the
            ships, and Odysseus led the way. But Patroklos told his men and the maid-servants to
            make ready a comfortable bed for Phoenix; [660] they therefore did so with sheepskins, a
            rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till
            divine Dawn came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him [665] the daughter
            of Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroklos lay on the
            other side of the room, and with him fair-waisted Iphis whom radiant Achilles had given
            him when he took Skyros the city of Enyeus. </p>
          <p>When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, [670] the Achaeans rose,
            pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King Agamemnon was the first
            to do so. “Tell me, honored Odysseus,” said he, “will he save the ships from burning,
            [675] or did be refuse, and is he still furious?” </p>
          <p>Long-suffering Odysseus answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,
            Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, and spurns both you
            and your gifts. [680] He bids you take counsel with the Argives to save the ships and
            army of warriors as you best may; as for himself, he said that at daybreak he should
            draw his oarswept ships into the water. He said further that he should advise every one
            to sail [685] home likewise, for that you will not reach the goal of Ilion. ‘Wide-seeing
            Zeus,’ he said, ‘has laid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have
            taken heart.’ This is what he said, and the others who were with me can tell you the
            same story—Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may be trusted. [690] The
            old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for so Achilles would have it, that he
            might go home with him in the morning if he so would; but he will not take him by
            force.” </p>
          <p>The sons of the Achaeans all held their peace, sitting [695] for a long time silent and
            dejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till
            presently Diomedes of the great war cry said, “Most noble son of Atreus, lordly king of
            men, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the blameless son of Peleus nor offered him
            gifts. He is proud enough as it is, [700] and you have encouraged him in his pride and
            further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later when he is in the humor, and
            the gods put it in his mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; [705] we
            have eaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in rest there is both
            strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, O son of Atreus, right away
            bring out your army of warriors and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on,
            and yourself fighting among the foremost.”</p>
          <p>[710] Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved, acclaiming the words of
            Diomedes, breaker of horses. They then made their drink-offerings and went every man to
            his own tent, where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 10</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole
            night through, but Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the people, was troubled, so
            that he could get no rest. [5] As when lovely-haired Hera’s lord flashes his lightning
            in token of great rain or incessant hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground,
            or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did Agamemnon
            heave many a heavy sigh, [10] for his spirit trembled within him. When he looked upon
            the plain of Troy he marveled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilion, and at
            the sound of pipes and reeds and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards
            the ships and armies of the Achaeans, [15] he tore his hair by handfuls before Zeus on
            high, and groaned aloud for the very restlessness of his spirit. In the end he thought
            it best to go at once to Nestor, son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find
            any way [20] of the Danaans from destruction. He therefore rose, slipped on his tunic,
            bound his fair sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over
            his shoulders—a skin that reached his feet—and took his spear in his hand.</p>
          <p>[25] Neither could Menelaos sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives who for his
            sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the Trojans. He covered his broad back
            with the skin of a spotted panther, [30] put a helmet of bronze upon his head, and took
            his spear in his brawny hand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most
            powerful of the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">33</seg> and he got honor <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>from the population [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>], like a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting
            his goodly array about his shoulders, [35] and right glad was he that his brother had
            come. </p>
          <p>Menelaos spoke first. “Why,” said he, “my dear brother, are you thus arming? Are you
            going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans? I greatly fear that no one
            will do you this service, [40] and spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It
            will be a deed of great daring.” </p>
          <p>And powerful Agamemnon answered, “Illustrious Menelaos, we both of us need shrewd
            counsel to save [45]the Argives and our ships, for Zeus has changed his mind, and
            inclines towards Hector’s sacrifices rather than ours. I never saw nor heard tell of any
            man as having wrought such ruin in one day as Hector, beloved of Zeus, has now wrought
            against the sons of the Achaeans— [50] and that too of his own unaided self, for he is
            son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will regret it long and deeply. Run,
            therefore, with all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.
            Meanwhile I will go to Nestor the radiant, [55] and bid him rise and go about among the
            companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they will listen to him
            sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are
            chiefs over them. It was to them more particularly that we gave this charge.”</p>
          <p>[60] In turn Menelaos of the great war cry replied, “How do I take your meaning? Am I
            to stay with them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given
            your orders?” [65] “Wait,” answered King Agamemnon, “for there are so many paths about
            the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on your way, and bid him be
            stirring; name him by his lineage and by his father’s name, give each all titular
            observance, and stand not too much upon your own dignity; [70] we must take our full
            share of toil, for at our birth Zeus laid this heavy burden upon us.” </p>
          <p>With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on to Nestor, shepherd
            of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent hard by his own black ship; [75] his
            goodly armor lay beside him—his shield, his two spears and his glittering helmet; beside
            him also lay the gleaming belt with which the old man girded himself when he armed to
            lead his people into battle—for his age stayed him not. [80] He raised himself on his
            elbow and looked up at the son of Atreus, Agamemnon. “Who is it,” said he, “that goes
            thus about the army of warriors and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men
            are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? [85]Do not
            stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?” </p>
          <p>And lord of men Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, son of Neleus, honor to the Achaean name,
            it is I, Agamemnon, son of Atreus, on whom Zeus has laid labor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] and sorrow so long as there is breath [90] in my body and my limbs
            carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart is big
            with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am
            at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap [95] out of my
            body, and my shining limbs fail me. If then you can do anything—for you too cannot
            sleep—let us go the round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and
            sleeping to the neglect of their duty. [100]The enemy is encamped hard and we know not
            but he may attack us by night.” </p>
          <p>Nestor, the charioteer of Gerenia, replied, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,
            Agamemnon, Zeus of the counsels will not do all for Hector [105] that Hector thinks he
            will; he will have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will
            go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus the spear-famed, or
            Odysseus, or fleet-footed Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. [110] Some one had also
            better go and call Ajax the great, the godlike one, and King Idomeneus, for their ships
            are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from blaming
            Menelaos, much as I love him and respect him— [115] and I will say so plainly, even at
            the risk of offending you—for sleeping and leaving all this trouble to yourself. He
            ought to be going about imploring aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are
            in extreme danger.” </p>
          <p>And the lord of men Agamemnon answered, [120] “Aged sir, you may sometimes blame him
            justly, for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself—not indeed from sloth, nor
            yet lack of good sense [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], but because he looks
            to me and expects me to take the lead. At this occasion, however, he was awake before I
            was, and came to me of his own accord. [125] I have already sent him to call the very
            men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find them with the watch
            outside the gates, for it was there I said that we would meet them.” </p>
          <p>“In that case,” answered Nestor, the charioteer of Gerenia, “the Argives will not blame
            him nor disobey his orders [130] when he urges them to fight or gives them
            instructions.” </p>
          <p>With this he put on his khiton, and bound his sandals about his comely feet. He buckled
            on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and of a rough shaggy texture, [135]
            grasped his terrifying bronze-shod spear, and wended his way along the line of the ships
            of the bronze-armored Achaeans. First he called loudly to Odysseus peer of gods in
            counsel and woke him, for he was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. [140] He
            came outside his tent and said, “Why do you go thus alone about the army of warriors,
            and along the line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find
            so urgent?” And Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, answered, “Resourceful Odysseus, noble
            son of Laertes, [145] take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in much grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may
            advise well with us whether we shall fight or flee.” </p>
          <p>Then resourceful Odysseus went at once into his tent, put his shield about his
            shoulders and came out with them. [150] First they went to Diomedes, son of Tydeus, and
            found him outside his tent clad in his armor with his comrades sleeping round him and
            using their shields as pillows; as for their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of
            their butts that were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like
            the lightning of father Zeus. The hero [155] was sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a
            piece of fine carpet under his head; high-spirited Nestor went up to him and stirred him
            with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir himself. “Wake up,”
            he exclaimed, “son of Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? [160] Can you not see
            that the Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a
            little space between us and them?”</p>
          <p>On these words Diomedes leaped up instantly and said, “Old man, your heart is of iron;
            you rest not one moment from your labors [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponoi</foreign>].
            [165] Are there no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the
            princes? There is no tiring you.” </p>
          <p>And Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, made answer, “My son, all that you have said is
            true. [170] I have good sons, and also much people who might call the chieftains, but
            the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death are balanced as it were on the
            edge of a razor. [175] Go then, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse
            swift Ajax and the fleet son of Phyleus.” </p>
          <p>Diomedes threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders—a skin that reached
            his feet—and grasped his spear. When he had roused the heroes, he brought them back with
            him; [180] they then went the round of those who were on guard, and found the chiefs not
            sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep
            dogs that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast [185] coming
            through the mountain forest towards them—right away there is a hue and cry of dogs and
            men, and slumber is broken—even so was sleep chased from the eyes of the Achaeans as
            they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned constantly towards the plain
            whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans. [190] The old man was glad and bade them
            be of good cheer. “Watch on, my children,” said he, “and let not sleep get hold upon
            you, lest our enemies triumph over us.” </p>
          <p>With this he passed the trench, and with him [195] the other chiefs of the Achaeans who
            had been called to the council. Meriones and the glorious son of Nestor went also, for
            the princes bade them. When they were beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they
            held their meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses, [200]
            for it was here that when night fell Hector, the huge, had turned back from his
            onslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one
            another. </p>
          <p>Aged Nestor spoke first. “My friends,” said he, “is there any man bold enough [205] to
            venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or bring us news of what the
            enemy mean to do—whether they will stay here by the ships away from the city, or
            whether, [210] now that they have worsted the Achaeans, they will retire within their
            walls. If he could learn all this and come back safely here, his fame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] would be sky-high in the mouths of all men, and he
            would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all our ships [215] would each of them
            give him a black ewe with her lamb—which is a present of surpassing value—and he would
            be asked as a guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.” </p>
          <p>They all held their peace, but Diomedes of the loud war-cry spoke saying, [220]
            “Nestor, my heart and bold spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] urge me to
            visit the army of the hateful Trojans over against us, but if another will go with me I
            shall do so in greater confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them
            [225] may see some opportunity [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>] which the
            other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone his thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>] is slower, and his cunning intelligence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mētis</foreign>] is slight.” </p>
          <p>Then several offered to go with Diomedes. The two Ajaxes, attendants [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all
            wanted to go, [230] so did Menelaos the spear-famed; patient Odysseus also wished to go
            among the army of the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and then Agamemnon, king
            of men, spoke thus: “Diomedes,” said he, “son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, [235]
            choose your comrade for yourself—take the best man of those that have offered, for many
            would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst
            out of respect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] for his lineage, because he is
            of more royal blood.” </p>
          <p>[240] He said this because he feared for fair-haired Menelaos. Diomedes answered, “If
            you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail to think of
            god-like Odysseus, than whom there is no man more eager in heart and bold spirit
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] to face [245] all kinds of ordeal
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>]—and Pallas Athena loves him well? If he
            were to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick to see and
            understand.”</p>
          <p>Long-suffering radiant Odysseus replied, <seg rend="subscript">249</seg> “Son of
            Tydeus! Give me neither too much praise [verb from <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ainos</foreign>] nor too much blame [verb from <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >neikos</foreign>]; [250] you are saying these things in the presence of Argives who
            know. Let us be going, for the night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone
            forward, two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left
            us.” </p>
          <p>They then put on their armor. [255] Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of Tydeus with a
            sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship) and on his head he set a helmet
            of bull’s hide without either peak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common
            headgear. [260] Meriones found a bow and quiver for Odysseus, and on his head he set a
            leather helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leather thongs, while on the
            outside it was thickly studded with boar’s teeth, [265] well and skillfully set into it;
            next the head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by
            Autolykos out of Eleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor, son of Ormenos. He gave
            it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Skandeia, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift
            to Molos, [270] who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the head of
            Odysseus. </p>
          <p>When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains behind them.
            Pallas Athena [275] sent them a heron by the wayside upon their right hands; they could
            not see it for the darkness, but they heard its cry. Odysseus was glad when he heard it
            and prayed to Athena: “Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, you who spy
            out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponoi</foreign>]; [280] befriend me in this my hour, and grant that we may return to
            the ships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring
            sorrow to the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry also prayed: “Hear me too,” said he, “daughter of
            Zeus, the one who cannot be worn down; [285] be with me even as you were with my noble
            father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans. He left the
            bronze-armored Achaeans by the banks of the river Aisopos, and went to the city bearing
            a message of peace to the Kadmeians; on his return thence, [290] with your help, divine
            goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper. Even so guide me
            and guard me now, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a
            year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns
            and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.”</p>
          <p>[295] Thus they prayed, and Pallas Athena heard their prayer. When they had done
            praying to the daughter of great Zeus, they went their way like two lions prowling by
            night amid the armor and bloodstained bodies of them that had fallen. </p>
          <p>Neither again did Hector let the high-hearted Trojans [300] sleep; for he too called
            the princes and councilors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel before them. “Is
            there one,” said he, “who for a great reward will do me the service of which I will tell
            you? He shall be well paid if he will. [305] I will give him a chariot and a couple of
            strong-necked horses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he
            will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honor to boot; he must go to the ships
            and find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, [310] or whether now that we
            have beaten them the Achaeans design to flee, and through sheer exhaustion are
            neglecting to keep their watches.” </p>
          <p>They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain man named Dolon,
            son of Eumedes, [315] the famous herald—a man rich in gold and bronze. He was
            ill-favored, but a good runner, and was an only son among five sisters. He it was that
            now addressed Hector and the Trojans with these words [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mūthos</foreign>]. “Hector, [320] “my heart and bold spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>] urge me to go to the ships and exploit them. But first hold up your
            scepter and swear that you will give me the chariot, bright with bronze, and the horses
            that now carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail
            you. [325] I will go through the army from one end to the other till I come to the ship
            of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now consulting whether
            they shall fight or flee.” </p>
          <p>When he had done speaking Hector held up his scepter, and swore him his oath saying,
            “May Zeus, the thundering husband of Hera, bear witness [330] that no other Trojan but
            yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you shall have your will with them for
            ever.” </p>
          <p>The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going. He hung his bow
            over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin of a gray wolf, while on his head
            he set [335] a cap of ferret skin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for
            the ships, but he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left the
            horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but illustrious Odysseus
            [340] perceived his coming and said to Diomedes, “Diomedes, here is some one from the
            camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would plunder
            the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, [345] we can then spring upon him
            and take him. If, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem
            him in towards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the
            town.” </p>
          <p>With this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses. [350] Dolon
            suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got about as far as the distance
            by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that has been plowed by oxen (for mules can
            plow fallow land quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their
            footsteps he stood still, [355] for he was sure they were friends from the Trojan camp
            come by Hector’s orders to bid him return; when, however, they were only a spear’s cast,
            or less away form him, he saw that they were enemies and ran away as fast as his legs
            could take him. The others gave chase at once, [360] and as a couple of well-trained
            hounds press forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so
            did the son of Tydeus and Odysseus, ransacker of cities, pursue Dolon and cut him off
            from his own people. [365] But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would
            soon have fallen in with the outposts, Athena infused fresh strength into the son of
            Tydeus for fear some other of the bronze-armored Achaeans might have the glory of being
            first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; powerful Diomedes therefore
            sprang forward with his spear and said, [370] “Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in
            that case I shall soon make an end of you.” </p>
          <p>He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew over the man’s right
            shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood stock still, trembling and in great
            fear; [375] his teeth chattered, and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless
            up to him and seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, “Take me alive; I
            will ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, [380] and
            from this my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my
            being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>“Fear not,” replied resourceful Odysseus, “let no thought of death be in your mind; but
            tell me, and tell me true, [385] why are you thus going about alone in the dead of night
            away from your camp and towards the ships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to
            plunder the bodies of the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at
            the ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>]?” </p>
          <p>[390] Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: “Hector, with his vain
            flattering promises, lured me into derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>].
            He said he would give me the horses of the proud son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened
            chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the fleeing night, [395] get close to the
            enemy, and find out whether the ships are still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now
            that we have beaten them, the Achaeans design to flee, and through sheer exhaustion are
            neglecting to keep their watches.”</p>
          <p>[400] Resourceful Odysseus smiled at him and answered, “You had indeed set your heart
            upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of valiant Aiakos are hardly to be
            kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles himself, whose mother was
            an immortal. [405] But tell me, and tell me true, where did you leave Hector, the
            people’s shepherd, when you started? Where lies his armor and his horses? How, too, are
            the watches and sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they
            [410] stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the
            Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?” And Dolon son of Eumedes answered, “I
            will tell you truly all. <seg rend="subscript">414</seg> Hector, accompanied by all his
            advisors, [415] is planning plans [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">boulas bouleuei</foreign>]
            at the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of godlike Ilos, away from the
            general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me, there is no watch selected
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] to keep guard over the army of warriors.
            The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, are
            awake and keep [420] each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies who have come
            from other places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives
            and children are not here.”</p>
          <p>Illustrious Odysseus then said, “Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan
            troops, [425] or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.” </p>
          <p>“I will tell you truly all,” replied Dolon Eumedes’ son. “To the seaward lie the
            Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Kaukones, and the noble Pelasgoi. [430]
            The Lycians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygian horsemen and Maeonian charioteers, have
            their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask about all this? If you want to find
            your way into the army of the Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come
            here and lie apart from the others [435] at the far end of the camp; and they have
            Rhesus, son of Eioneus, for their king. His horses were the finest and strongest that I
            have ever seen. <seg rend="subscript">437</seg> And they were whiter than snow, and they
            were like [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">homoioi</foreign>] the winds, the way they ran. His
            chariot is bright with silver and gold, and he has brought his marvelous golden armor,
            of the rarest workmanship— [440] too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only
            for the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the fast-running ships or bind me securely
            here, until you come back and have proved my words [445] whether they be false or
            true.” </p>
          <p>Powerful Diomedes looked sternly at him and answered, “Think not, Dolon, for all the
            good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you are in our hands, for
            if we ransom you or let you go, [450] you will come some second time to the fast ships
            of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and make an end
            of you, you will give no more trouble.” </p>
          <p>Then Dolon would have caught him by the beard [455] to beseech him further, but
            Diomedes struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword and cut through both sinews
            so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet speaking. They took the
            ferret-skin cap from his head, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear.
            [460] Radiant Odysseus hung them up aloft in honor of Athena, the goddess of plunder,
            and prayed saying, “Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference to all
            the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards the horses and
            sleeping-ground of the Thracians.” </p>
          <p>[465] With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree, and they
            made a mark [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of the place by pulling up reeds
            and gathering boughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through
            the fleeing hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid fallen armor and dark
            blood, [470] and came presently to the company of Thracian warriors, who were sleeping,
            tired out with their day’s toil; their goodly armor was lying on the ground beside them
            all in order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>] in three rows, and each man had
            his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his
            fast horses [475] were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Odysseus from some
            way off saw him and said, “This, Diomedes, is the man, and these are the horses about
            which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; [480] dally not about your
            armor, but loose the horses at once—or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the
            horses.” </p>
          <p>Then owl-vision Athena put courage into the heart of Diomedes, and he smote them right
            and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked about, and the earth
            was red with their blood. [485] As a lion springs furiously upon a flock of sheep or
            goats when he finds without their shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the
            Thracian warriors till he had killed twelve. As he killed them resourceful Odysseus came
            [490] and drew them aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward
            freely without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not
            yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, [495] he killed him too
            (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by the counsel of Athena an evil
            dream, the seed of Oineus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile patient Odysseus
            untied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off, [500] striking them
            with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled
            as a sign to radiant Diomedes. </p>
          <p>But Diomedes stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he might accomplish.
            He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which the king’s armor was lying, [505]
            and draw it out by the pole, or to lift the armor out and carry it off; or whether
            again, he should not kill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Athena came
            up to him and said, “Make your return [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>],
            Diomedes, son of great-hearted Tydeus [510] to the ships or you may be driven there,
            should some other god rouse the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>Diomedes knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses. Odysseus
            beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the rapid ships of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>[515] But Apollo kept no blind lookout when he saw Athena with the son of Tydeus. He
            was angry with her, and coming to the army of the Trojans he roused Hippokoön, a
            counselor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep
            [520] and saw that the horses were no longer in their place, and that the men were
            gasping in their death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by
            name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together,
            and they marveled at the deeds [525] of the heroes who had now got away towards the
            black ships. </p>
          <p>When they reached the place where they had killed Hector’s scout, Odysseus the beloved
            of Zeus stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the ground, placed the
            bloodstained spoils in the hands of Odysseus and remounted: [530] then he lashed the
            horses onwards, and they flew forward eagerly towards the ships as though of their own
            free will. Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. “My friends,” said he,
            “princes and counselors of the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong?—but I must say
            what I think: [535] there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope it may
            Diomedes and Odysseus driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the
            bravest of the Argives may have come to some harm at their hands.”</p>
          <p>[540] He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted, whereon the
            others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated them. Nestor charioteer of
            Gerenia was first to question them. “Tell me,” said he, “renowned Odysseus, [545] how
            did you two come by these horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some
            god meet you and give them to you? They shine terribly, like sunbeams. I am well
            conversant with the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships,
            [550] but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god must
            have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you dear to Zeus, who gathers
            the clouds, and to Zeus’ owl-vision daughter Athena.” </p>
          <p>And glorious Odysseus answered, [555] “Nestor son of Neleus, honor to the Achaean name,
            the gods, if they so will, can give us even better horses than these, for they are far
            mightier than we are. These horses, however, about which you ask me, are freshly come
            from Thrace. Brave Diomedes killed their king [560] with the twelve bravest of his
            companions. Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man—a scout whom Hector and the
            haughty Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.” </p>
          <p>He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, [565] while the other
            Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly built quarters of the son
            of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds
            of Diomedes stood eating their sweet wheat, [570] but Odysseus hung the bloodstained
            spoils of Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to
            Athena. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their
            bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had taken all the sweat
            [575] from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into the polished baths and
            washed themselves. After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat
            down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of
            sweet-hearted wine to Athena.</p>

          <p rend="no-indent">[1] And now as Dawn rose from her couch beside haughty Tithonos,
            harbinger of light alike to mortals and immortals, Zeus sent fierce Discord with the
            ensign of war in her hands to the fast ships of the Achaeans. [5] She took her stand by
            the huge black hull of Odysseus’ ship which was middlemost of all, so that her voice
            might carry farthest on either side, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of
            Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles—for these two heroes, well-assured
            of their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line.
            [10] There she took her stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the
            Achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all their might,
            so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go home in their ships.</p>
          <p>[15] The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves for battle
            while he put on his armor. First he girded his goodly greaves about his legs, making
            them fast with ankle clasps of silver; and about his chest he set the breastplate [20]
            which Kinyras had once given him as a guest-gift. The story [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>], which reached as far as Cyprus, was that the Achaeans were about to
            sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to the king. It had ten circles of dark lapis,
            [25] twelve of gold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of lapis that reared themselves
            up towards the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son of Kronos
            has set in the sky as a sign to mortal men. About his shoulders he threw his sword,
            studded with bosses [30] of gold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold
            wherewith to hang it. He took moreover the richly-wrought shield that covered his body
            when he was in battle—fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running all round it. On
            the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, [35] with another of dark
            lapis in the middle: this last was made to show a blank-eyed Gorgon’s head, fierce and
            grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of
            silver, on which there was a writhing snake of lapis with three heads [40] that sprang
            from a single neck, and went in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set a
            helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair that nodded
            menacingly above it; then he grasped two terrifying bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of
            his armor shot from him as a flame into the firmament, [45] while Hera and Athena
            thundered in honor of the king of rich Mycenae. </p>
          <p>Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold them in proper order
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>] by the trench, while he went into battle
            on foot clad in full armor, [50] and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. The
            chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there, but these came up
            presently. The son of Kronos sent a portent of evil sound about their army of warriors,
            and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about [55] to send many a brave man hurrying
            down to Hādēs. </p>
          <p>The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, were gathered round
            great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas—  <seg rend="subscript">58</seg> who got honor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] from the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>] of the Trojans, like a god— and the three sons of Antenor, Polybos,
            radiant Agenor, [60] and young Akamas, beauteous as a god. Hector’s round shield showed
            in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines for a moment through a rent in
            the clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now seen in the front
            ranks [65] and now again in the rear, and his bronze armor gleamed like the lightning of
            aegis-bearing Zeus. And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a
            rich man’s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, [70] even so did the Trojans
            and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood for yielding but fought like
            wolves, and neither side got the better of the other. Discord, the Lady of Sorrow, was
            glad as she beheld them, for she was the only god that went among them; [75] the others
            were not there, but stayed quietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of
            Olympus. All of them blamed the son of Kronos, Zeus of the dark mists, for wanting to
            give victory to the Trojans, [80] but father Zeus heeded them not: he held aloof from
            all, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of the
            Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and alike upon the slayers and
            on the slain. </p>
          <p>Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, [85] their darts rained thick
            and fast, and the people perished, but as the hour drew near when a woodman working in
            some mountain forest will get his midday meal—for he has felled till his hands are
            weary; he is tired out, and must now have food— [90] then the Danaans with a cry that
            rang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon led them on,
            and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer
            Oïleus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming full towards him; [95] but Agamemnon
            struck him on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the
            weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were battered in and he
            was killed in full fight. </p>
          <p>Agamemnon stripped their khitons from off them [100] and left them with their breasts
            all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to kill Isos and renowned
            Antiphos, two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other born in wedlock; they were in
            the same chariot—the bastard driving, while noble Antiphos fought beside him. Achilles
            had once [105] taken both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them
            with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now,
            however, wide-powerful Agamemnon, son of Atreus, smote Isos in the chest above the
            nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphos hard by the ear and threw him from his
            chariot. [110] Right away he stripped their goodly armor from off them and recognized
            them, for he had already seen them at ships when Achilles of the swift feet brought them
            in from Ida. As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great
            jaws, [115] robbing them of their tender life while he is on his way back to his
            lair—the hind can do nothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an
            agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed
            before the mighty monster— [120] so, no man of the Trojans could help Isos and Antiphos,
            for they were themselves fleeing in panic before the Argives. </p>
          <p>Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of high-spirited Antimakhos, Peisandros and brave
            Hippolokhos. [125] It was Antimakhos who had been foremost in preventing Helen’s being
            restored to fair-haired Menelaos, for he was lavishly bribed by Alexandros; and now
            powerful Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying to bring their
            horses to a stand—for they had lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear.
            [130] The son of Atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from
            their chariot. “Take us alive,” they cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall receive a
            great ransom for us. Our father Antimakhos has great store of gold, bronze, and wrought
            iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large ransom [135] should he hear of
            our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they heard no pitiful
            answer in return. “If,” said Agamemnon, “you are sons of high-spirited Antimakhos, who
            once at a council of Trojans proposed [140] that Menelaos and godlike Odysseus, who had
            come to you as envoys, should be killed and not allowed to return, you shall now pay for
            the foul iniquity of your father.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he felled Peisandros from his chariot to the earth, smiting him on the
            chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon the ground. [145] Hippolokhos
            fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he cut off his hands and his head—which he sent
            rolling in among the crowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and
            wherever the ranks were thickest there he flew, while the other strong-greaved Achaeans
            followed. [150] Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them,
            and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of the horses
            raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying
            them and cheering on the Achaeans. [155] As when some mighty forest is all ablaze—the
            eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are consumed
            before the blast of the flame—even so fell the heads of the fleeing Trojans before
            powerful Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and many a noble pair of steeds [160] drew an empty
            chariot along the highways of war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more
            useful now to vultures than to their wives. </p>
          <p>Zeus drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and din of battle;
            [165] but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily to the Danaans. They flew
            on by the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of old Ilos, son of Dardanos,
            in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree making always for
            the city—the son of Atreus still shouting, and with invincible hands all dripping in
            gore; [170] but when they had reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, there they
            halted and waited for the others to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on fleeing over
            the middle of the plain like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has
            attacked them in the dead of night—he springs on one of them, [175] seizes her neck in
            the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges himself upon her
            entrails—even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the
            hindmost as they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong from his
            chariot [180] by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury. </p>
          <p>But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the father of gods and
            men came down from the sky and took his seat, thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of
            Ida, with its many springs. [185] He then told Iris of the golden wings to carry a
            message for him. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector—say that so long
            as he sees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep
            aloof and bid the others [190] bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is
            wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will I grant him
            strength to slay till he reach the strong-benched ships and night falls at the going
            down of the sun.”</p>
          <p>[195] Swift wind-footed Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilion from
            the crests of Ida, and found radiant Hector son of high-spirited Priam standing by his
            chariot and horses. Then she said, [200] “Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel,
            father Zeus has sent me to bear you this message—so long as you see Agamemnon heading
            his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others
            [205] bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or
            arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will Zeus grant you strength to slay till you
            reach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.” </p>
          <p>[210] When she had thus spoken swift-footed Iris left him, and <seg rend="subscript"
              >211</seg> Hector leapt out of his chariot, armor and all, brandishing his spear as he
            went about everywhere among the army of warriors, cheering his men on to fight, and
            stirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again met the
            Achaeans, [215] while the Argives on their part strengthened their battalions. The
            battle was now in array and they stood face to face with one another, Agamemnon ever
            pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all others. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">218</seg> Tell me now you Muses dwelling on Olympus, <seg
              rend="subscript">219</seg> who was the first to come up and face Agamemnon, [220]
            either among the Trojans or among their famous allies? <seg rend="subscript"
            >221</seg> It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both good and great, <seg
              rend="subscript">222</seg> who was raised in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. <seg
              rend="subscript">223</seg> Kissēs in his own house raised him when he was little. <seg
              rend="subscript">224</seg> Kissēs was his mother’s father, father to Theano, the one
            with the fair cheeks. [225] When he [= Iphidamas] reached the stage of adolescence,
            which brings luminous glory, <seg rend="subscript">226</seg> he [= Kissēs] wanted to
            keep him at home and to give him his own daughter in marriage, <seg rend="subscript"
              >227</seg> but as soon as he [= Iphidamas] had married, he left the bride chamber and
            went off seeking the kleos of the Achaeans <seg rend="subscript">228</seg> along with
            twelve curved ships that followed him: these he had left at Perkote [230] and had come
            on by land to Ilion. He it was that now met Agamemnon, son of Atreus. When they were
            close up with one another, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on
            the belt below the cuirass [235] and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his
            strength of arm; the belt, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the point of the
            spear struck against the silver and was turned aside as though it had been lead: King
            Agamemnon caught it [240] from his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a
            lion; he then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there
            the poor man lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the defense of his
            comrades, far from his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kharis</foreign>] though he had given much for her: he had given a hundred-head of
            cattle down, and had promised later on to give a thousand [245] sheep and goats mixed,
            from the countless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then
            despoiled him, and carried off his armor into the army of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>When noble Koön, Antenor’s eldest son, saw this, he felt grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] [250] in his eyes at the sight of his fallen
            brother. Unseen by great Agamemnon he got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in
            the middle of his arm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the
            arm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, [255] but still not even for this did he leave
            off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and
            sprang upon Koön who was trying to drag off the body of his brother—his father’s son—by
            the foot, and was crying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon
            struck him [260] with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead
            body through the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut off his head,
            standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the
            hands of the son of Atreus, and go down into the house of Hādēs. </p>
          <p>As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went about attacking
            the ranks of the enemy [265] with spear and sword and with great handfuls of stone, but
            when the blood had ceased to flow and the wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the
            sharp pangs [270] which the Eileithuiai, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Hera and
            dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labor—even so sharp were the
            pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer drive
            to the ships, for he was in great agony. [275] With a loud clear voice he shouted to the
            Danaans, “My friends, princes and counselors of the Argives, defend the ships
            yourselves, for Zeus has not allowed me to fight the whole day through against the
            Trojans.”</p>
          <p>[280] With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and they flew
            forward, holding nothing back. Their chests were white with foam and their bellies with
            dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the battle. </p>
          <p>When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, [285] he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians
            saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit
            yourselves in battle bravely; their best man has left them, and Zeus has granted me a
            great triumph; charge [290] the foe with your chariots that you may win still greater
            glory.”</p>
          <p>With these words he put heart and spirit into them all, and as a huntsman hounds his
            dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector, [295] peer of Arēs, hound the
            proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost,
            and fell on the fight like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes
            its deep waters [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] into fury. </p>
          <p>What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed [300] in the hour
            of triumph which Zeus then granted him? First Asaios, Autonoos, and Opites; Dolops, son
            of Klytios, Opheltios and Agelaos; Aisymnos, Oros and Hipponoos steadfast in battle;
            these chieftains of the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then [305] he fell upon the rank
            and file. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them
            down with the fierceness of its fury—the waves of the sea roll high, and the spray is
            flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind—even so thick were the heads of them that
            fell by the hand of Hector.</p>
          <p>[310] All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would have fled
            pell-mell to their ships, had not Odysseus cried out to Diomedes, “Son of Tydeus, what
            has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess? Come, my good man, stand by my side
            and help me, we shall be [315] shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.” </p>
          <p>And Diomedes answered, “Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall have scant joy
            of it, <seg rend="subscript">318</seg> since Zeus the cloud-gatherer <seg
              rend="subscript">319</seg> wills to give the victory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kratos</foreign>] to the Trojans instead of us.”</p>
          <p>[320] With these words he struck Thymbraios from his chariot to the ground, smiting him
            in the left breast with his spear, while Odysseus killed godlike Molion who was his
            attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>]. These they let lie, now that
            they had stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with the foe,
            like two wild boars [325] that turn in fury and rend the hounds that hunt them. Thus did
            they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and the Achaeans were thankful to have
            breathing time in their flight from Hector. </p>
          <p>They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops from the district
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Perkote, who excelled all others [330]
            in the arts of divination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would
            not obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomedes of the renowned spear, son of
            Tydeus deprived them of their life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >psūkhē </foreign>pl.] and stripped them of their armor, [335] while Odysseus killed
            Hippodamos and Hypeirokhos. </p>
          <p>And now the son of Kronos as he looked down from Ida ordained that neither side should
            have the advantage, and they kept on killing one another. The son of Tydeus speared
            Agastrophos, son of Paion, in the hip-joint with his spear. His chariot [340] was not at
            hand for him to flee with, so blindly confident had he been. His attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] was in charge of it at some distance and he was
            fighting on foot among the foremost until he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc
            Diomedes and Odysseus were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by
            the Trojan ranks; [345] brave Diomedes was dismayed when he saw them, and said to
            Odysseus who was beside him, “Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be
            undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.” </p>
          <p>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, [350] nor did he miss his mark. He had
            aimed at Hector’s head near the top of his helmet, but bronze was turned by bronze, and
            Hector was untouched, for the spear was stayed by the visored helmet made with three
            plates of metal, which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great
            bound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself [355] with his
            brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes. The son of
            Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the foremost fighters, to the place where
            he had seen it strike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back
            into his chariot [360] mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life. But
            Diomedes made at him with his spear and said, “Dog, you have again got away though death
            was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to whom I think you pray before you go into
            battle, has again saved you, [365] nevertheless I will meet you and make an end of you
            hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the
            present I must pursue those I can lay hands on.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the spear-famed son of Paion, but
            Alexandros husband of lovely-haired Helen [370] aimed an arrow at him, leaning against a
            pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilos, son of Dardanos, a ruler in days of
            old. Diomedes had taken the cuirass from off the breast of strong Agastrophos, his heavy
            helmet also, and the shield from off his shoulders, [375] when Paris drew his bow and
            let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of Diomedes’
            right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in the ground. Then Paris with a
            hearty laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and taunted him saying, [380] “You
            are wounded—my arrow has not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly
            and killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had
            a truce from evil.” </p>
          <p>Diomedes all undaunted answered, [385] “Archer, you who without your bow are nothing,
            slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single combat fighting in full armor,
            your bow and your arrows would serve you in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you
            have scratched the sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some inept boy
            [390] had hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound a man
            though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His
            wife will tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless: there will he
            [395] rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather
            round him.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, but Odysseus came up and stood over him. Under this cover he sat down to
            draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the pain he suffered as he did so. Then he
            sprang on to his chariot and bade the charioteer [400] drive him to the ships, for he
            was sick at heart. </p>
          <p>Odysseus was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they were all
            panic-stricken. “Alas,” said he to himself in his dismay, “what will become of me? It is
            ill [405] if I turn and flee before these odds, but it will be worse if I am left alone
            and taken prisoner, for the son of Kronos has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.
            But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards quit the field, a
            hero, [410] whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his own.” </p>
          <p>While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced and hemmed him in,
            and bitterly did they come to rue it. As hounds and lusty youths set upon a wild boar
            [415] that sallies from his lair whetting his white tusks—they attack him from every
            side and can hear the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold
            their ground—even so furiously did the Trojans [420] attack Odysseus. First he sprang
            spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then
            he killed Thoön and Ennomos. After these he struck Khersidamas in the loins under his
            shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; [425] so he fell in the dust and
            clutched the earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound
            Kharops, son of Hippasos, own brother to noble Sokos. Sokos, hero that he was, made all
            speed to help him, and when he was close to Odysseus he said, [430] “Far-famed Odysseus,
            insatiable of craft and toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>], this day you
            shall either boast of having killed both the sons of Hippasos and stripped them of their
            armor, or you shall fall before my spear.” </p>
          <p>With these words he struck the shield of Odysseus. [435] The spear went through the
            shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass, tearing the flesh from his
            side, but Pallas Athena did not allow it to pierce the entrails of the hero. Odysseus
            knew that his hour [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] was not yet come, [440]
            but he gave ground and said to Sokos, “Wretch, you shall now surely die. You have stayed
            me from fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, [445]
            yielding glory to myself, and your spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] to
            Hādēs of the noble steeds.” </p>
          <p>Sokos had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him in the back midway
            between the shoulders, and went right through his chest. He fell heavily to the ground
            and Odysseus boasted over him saying, [450] “O Sokos, son of high-spirited Hippasos
            tamer of horses, the end [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] has been too quick
            for you and you have not escaped it: poor wretch, not even in death shall your father
            and mother close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you with the
            flapping of their dark wings and devour you. [455] Whereas even though I fall the
            Achaeans will give me my due rites of burial.” </p>
          <p>So saying he drew Sokos’ heavy spear out of his flesh and from his shield, and the
            blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the
            great-hearted Trojans saw that Odysseus was bleeding [460] they raised a great shout and
            came on in a body towards him; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come
            and help him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and three times did brave
            Menelaos hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said,
            [465] “Ajax, noble son of Telamon, chief of your people, the cry of patient Odysseus
            rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off and were defeating him while he
            is single-handed. Let us make our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend
            him; [470] I fear he may come to harm for all his valor if he be left without support,
            and the Danaans would miss him sorely.” </p>
          <p>He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered round Odysseus
            like ravenous mountain jackals round [475] the carcass of some horned stag that has been
            hit with an arrow—the stag has fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his
            strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him
            [480] in the shady glades of the forest. Then a superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] sends a fierce lion there, whereon the jackals flee
            in terror and the lion robs them of their prey—even so did Trojans many and brave gather
            round crafty Odysseus, but the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear. [485]
            Ajax then came up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the
            Trojans fled in all directions. Warlike Menelaos took Odysseus by the hand, and led him
            out of the press while his attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>]
            brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed Doryklos,
            [490] a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandokos, Lysandros, Pyrasos, and
            Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from the mountains on to
            the plain, big with the rain of the sky—many a dry oak and many a pine does it engulf,
            [495] and much mud does it bring down and cast into the sea—even so did brave Ajax chase
            the foe furiously over the plain, slaying both men and horses. </p>
          <p>Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on the extreme left of
            the battle by the banks of the river Skamandros, where [500] the carnage was thickest
            and the war-cry loudest round Nestor and brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making
            great slaughter with his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that
            were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground, [505] had not
            Alexandros, husband of lovely-haired Helen, stayed the prowess of Makhaon shepherd of
            his people, by wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The
            Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans might
            take him prisoner, [510] and Idomeneus said to radiant Nestor, “Nestor, son of Neleus,
            honor to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; take Makhaon with you and drive
            your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is worth more than several
            other men put together, for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.”</p>
          <p>[515] Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, did as Idomeneus had counseled; he at once mounted
            his chariot, and Makhaon, son of the famed physician Asklepios, went with him. He lashed
            his horses and they flew onward holding nothing [520] back towards the ships, as though
            of their own free will. </p>
          <p>Then Kebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from his place beside
            him, “Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme wing of the battle, while the
            other Trojans [525] are in pell-mell rout, they and their horses. Ajax, son of Telamon,
            is driving them before him; I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our
            chariot and horses there, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, [530] and
            where the cry of battle is loudest.” </p>
          <p>With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the singing whip they drew
            the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over the bodies and shields of
            those that had fallen: the axle [535] was bespattered with blood, and the rail round the
            car was covered with splashes both from the horses’ hooves and from the tires of the
            wheels. Hector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and
            his presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was [540] not long idle;
            nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear, and throwing great
            stones, he avoided Ajax, son of Telamon, for Zeus would have been angry with him if he
            had fought a better man than himself.</p>
          <p>Then father Zeus from his high throne struck fear into the heart of Ajax, so that he
            stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him— [545] looking fearfully at the throng
            of his foes as though he were some wild beast, and turning here and there but crouching
            slowly backwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stockyard, and
            watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd— [550] he makes his
            greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him,
            with burning brands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks
            away, foiled and angry— [555] even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily
            before the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has
            had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he into a field begins eating the
            wheat—boys [560] beat him but he is too many for them, and though they lay about with
            their sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last drive him
            from the field—even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting
            the middle of his shield with their darts. [565] Now and again he would turn and show
            fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat; but
            he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway
            between the Trojans [570] and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some
            of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the
            ground before they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh. </p>
          <p>[575] Now when Eurypylos, the brave son of Euaimon, saw that Ajax was being overpowered
            by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his spear. He struck Apisaon, son of
            Phausios, in the liver below the midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylos sprang upon him,
            and stripped the armor from his shoulders; [580] but when godlike Alexandros saw him, he
            aimed an arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the
            point that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under
            cover of his comrades to save his life, [585] shouting as he did so to the Danaans, “My
            friends, princes and counselors of the Argives, rally to the defense of Ajax who is
            being overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. [590] This
            way, then, to the rescue of great Ajax, son of Telamon!” </p>
          <p>Even so did he cry when he was wounded; then the others came near, and gathered round
            him, holding their shields upwards from their shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax
            then made towards them, [595] and turned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached
            his men.</p>
          <p>Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, all
            in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out of the fight, and with him Makhaon,
            shepherd of his people. <seg rend="subscript">599</seg> He [Nestor] was seen and noted
            by swift-footed radiant Achilles, [600] who was standing on the spacious stern of his
              ship, <seg rend="subscript">601</seg> watching the sheer pain [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and tearful struggle of the fight. <seg
              rend="subscript">602</seg> Then, all of a sudden, he called to his comrade [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">hetairos</foreign>] Patroklos, <seg rend="subscript">603</seg> calling
            from the ship, and he [Patroklos] from inside the tent heard him [Achilles], <seg
              rend="subscript">604</seg> and he [Patroklos] came out, equal [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to Arēs, and here, I see it, was the beginning of his
            doom. [605] He [Patroklos], mighty son of Menoitios, was the first to speak, and he said
            [to Achilles]: <seg rend="subscript">606</seg> “Why, Achilles, do you call me? what need
            do you have for me?” And Achilles answered, “Noble son of Menoitios, man after my own
            heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in
            great straits; [610] go, Patroklos, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearing away
            wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Makhaon, son of Asklepios, but
            I could not see his face for the horses went by me at full speed.” </p>
          <p>[615] Patroklos did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running by the
            ships and tents of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>When Nestor and Makhaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus, they dismounted,
            and an attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>], Eurymedon, took the
            horses [620] from the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry
            the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside and took their
            seats. Fair Hekamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took
            it, mixed them a mixture; [625] she was daughter of high-spirited Arsinoos, and the
            Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First she
            set for them a fair and well-made table that had feet of lapis; on it there was a vessel
            of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, [630] with honey and cakes of
            barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old man had brought with
            him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which there
            were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. [635] Any one else would
            hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full, but Nestor could do so
            quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mixture with
            Pramnian wine; she grated goat’s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a
            handful of white barley-meal, [640] and having thus prepared the mixture she bade them
            drink it. When they had done so and had thus quenched their thirst, they fell talking
            with one another, and at this moment godlike Patroklos appeared at the door. </p>
          <p>When the old man saw him he sprang from his [645] seat, seized his hand, led him into
            the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but Patroklos stood where he was and
            said, “Noble sir, I may not stay, you cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is
            not one to be trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were
            bearing away from the field. I can now [650] see for myself that he is Makhaon, shepherd
            of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible man he
            is, and how ready to blame even where no blame should lie.” </p>
          <p>And Nestor answered, [655] “Why should Achilles care to know how many of the Achaeans
            may be wounded? He reckons not the grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]
            that reigns in our army of warriors; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave
            Diomedes, son of Tydeus, is wounded; [660] so are Odysseus and spear-famed Agamemnon;
            Eurypylos has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this
            man from the field—he too wounded—with an arrow; nevertheless Achilles, so valiant
            though he be, cares not. [665] Will he wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a
            blaze, and we perish one upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me
            any longer; would that I were still young and strong [670] as in the days when there was
            a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then killed
            Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirokhos a dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the
            spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown by my hand while fighting in the front rank in
            defense of his cows, [675] so he fell and the country people around him were in great
            fear. We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as
            many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of
            goats. Of horses moreover we seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, [680] and
            many had foals running with them. All these did we drive by night to Pylos, the city of
            Neleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had
            taken so much, though it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak
            the heralds went round crying [685] that all in Elis to whom there was a debt owing
            should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many to
            whom the Epeioi owed chattels, for we men of Pylos were few and had been oppressed with
            wrong; in former years Hēraklēs had come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, [690] so
            that all our best men had perished. Lordly Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was
            left; the others had all been killed. The bronze-armored Epeioi presuming upon all this
            had looked down upon us and had done us much evil. [695] My father chose [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] a herd of cattle and a great flock of sheep—three
            hundred in all—and he took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to
            him in Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots with them
            had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, [700] but King Augeas took them, and
            sent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus was angered by what
            he had both said and done, and took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that
            no man might have less than his full share. </p>
          <p>[705] Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods throughout the
            city; but three days afterwards the Epeioi came in a body, many in number, they and
            their chariots, in full array, and with them the two Moliones in their armor, though
            they were still lads and unused to fighting. [710] Now there is a certain town,
            Thryoessa, perched upon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylos; this they
            would destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had crossed their whole
            plain, Athena darted down by night from Olympus and bade us [715] set ourselves in
            array; and she found willing warriors in Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would
            not let me arm, and hid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about
            war; nevertheless Athena so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, [720] I fought
            among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them. There is a river Minyeios
            that falls into the sea near Arene, and there they that were mounted (and I with them)
            waited till morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force.
            Thence in full panoply and equipment [725] we came towards noon to the sacred waters of
            the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Zeus, with a bull to Alpheus,
            another to Poseidon, and a herd-heifer to owl-vision Athena. After this we took supper
            in our companies, [730] and laid us down to rest each in his armor by the river.</p>
          <p>The high-hearted Epeioi were beleaguering the city and were determined to take it, but
            before this might be there was a desperate fight in store for them. When the sun’s rays
            began to fall upon the earth [735] we joined battle, praying to Zeus and to Athena, and
            when the fight had begun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses—to wit the
            warrior Moulios. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter,
            golden-haired Agamede, [740] who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the
            face of the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when he fell headlong
            in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The
            high-hearted Epeioi fled in all directions when they saw the [745] chief of their
            horsemen (the best man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind,
            taking fifty chariots—and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I
            should have even killed the two Moliones sons [750] of Aktor, except their real father,
            Poseidon, lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out of
            the fight. Then Zeus granted the Pylians a great victory, for we chased them far over
            the plain, killing the men and bringing in their armor, [755] till we had brought our
            horses to Bouprasion rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called
            Alision, at which point Athena turned the people back. There I slew the last man and
            left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back from Bouprasion to Pylos [760] and
            gave thanks to Zeus among the gods, and among mortal men to Nestor. </p>
          <p>Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is for keeping all his
            excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] for himself; bitterly will he
            regret it hereafter when the army of warriors is being cut to pieces. My good friend,
            did not Menoitios charge you thus, [765] on the day when he sent you from Phthia to
            Agamemnon? Radiant Odysseus and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said
            to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits throughout all
            Achaea, and when we got [770] there we found Menoitios and yourself, and Achilles with
            you. The old charioteer Peleus was in the outer court, roasting the fat thigh-pieces of
            a heifer to Zeus the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which
            he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You two [775] were busy
            cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang
            to his feet, led us by the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us
            such hospitable entertainment as is right [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>]
            for guests. When we had satisfied ourselves with meat and drink, [780] I said my say and
            urged both of you to join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old men
            charged you much and strongly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the
            foremost and outcompete his peers, while Menoitios, the son of Aktor, spoke thus to you:
            [785] ‘My son,’ said he, ‘Achilles is of nobler birth than you are. <seg
              rend="subscript">787</seg> You are older; but he is much better in force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">bíē</foreign>]. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he
            will follow you to his own profit.’ Thus did your father charge you, but you have
            forgotten; nevertheless, even [790] now, say all this to high-spirited Achilles if he
            will listen to you. Who knows but with the help of a superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] you may talk him over, for it is good to take a
            friend’s advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told
            him something from Zeus, [795] then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons
            follow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him
            send you into battle clad in his own armor, that the Trojans may mistake you for him and
            leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath,
            [800] for they are hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You, who
            are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents
            and ships.” </p>
          <p>With these words he moved the heart of Patroklos, who set off running by the line of
            the ships to [805] Achilles, descendant of Aiakos. When he had got as far as the ships
            of Odysseus, where was their place of assembly and place for deciding what is right
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>], with their altars dedicated to the gods,
            Eurypylos, illustrious son of Euaimon, met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and
            limping [810] out of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black
            blood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >noos</foreign>] did not wander. The strong son of Menoitios when he saw him had
            compassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, [815] “O unhappy princes and counselors
            of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat, far from
            your friends and your native land? Say, noble Eurypylos, will the Achaeans be able to
            hold great Hector in check, [820] or will they fall now before his spear?” </p>
          <p>Wounded Eurypylos made answer, “Noble Patroklos, there is no hope left for the Achaeans
            but they will perish at their ships. All they that were princes among us [825] are lying
            struck down and wounded at the hands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and
            stronger. But save me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash
            the black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs [830]
            which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them by
            Cheiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the physicians Podaleirios and
            Makhaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of
            healing, [835] while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.” </p>
          <p>“Hero Eurypylos,” replied the brave son of Menoitios, “how may these things be? What
            can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble Achilles from Nestor of Gerenia,
            bulwark of the Achaeans, [840] but even so I will not be unmindful your distress.” </p>
          <p>With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent, and an attendant
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>], when he saw him, spread bullock-skins
            on the ground for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow
            from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound [845] with warm water; he then
            crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, and spread it upon the wound; this
            was a virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood
            left off flowing.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 12</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] So the warlike son of Menoitios was attending to the hurt of
            Eurypylos within the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor
            were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in check longer. [5]
            They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug the trench all round it that it
            might safeguard both the ships and the rich spoils which they had taken, but they had
            not offered hecatombs to the gods. It had been built without the consent of the
            immortals, and therefore it did not last. [10] So long as Hector lived and Achilles
            nursed his anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>], and so long as the city of
            Priam remained untaken, the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest
            of the Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were yet left
            alive [15] when, moreover, the city was destroyed in the tenth year, and the Argives had
            gone back with their ships to their own country—then Poseidon and Apollo took counsel to
            destroy the wall, and they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida
            into the sea, [20] Rhesus, Heptaporos, Karesos, Rhodios, Grenikos, Aisopos, and goodly
              Skamandros, <seg rend="subscript">22</seg> and Simoeis, where many cowhide-shields and
              helmets <seg rend="subscript">23</seg> fell in the dust—as also a generation of
            demigods [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hēmitheoi</foreign>]. Phoebus Apollo turned the
            mouths of all these rivers together [25] and made them flow for nine days against the
            wall, while Zeus rained the whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea.
            Poseidon himself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the
            foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with so much toil; [30] he
            made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont, and then when he had swept the
            wall away he spread a great beach of sand over the place where it had been. This done he
            turned the rivers back into their old courses. </p>
          <p>This was what Poseidon and Apollo were to [35] do in after time; but as yet battle and
            turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers rang under the blows that
            rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by the scourge of Zeus, were hemmed in at their
            ships in fear of Hector, the mighty minister of Rout, [40] who as heretofore fought with
            the force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogs and
            men that attack him, while these form solid wall and shower their javelins as they face
            him— [45] his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of him;
            many a time does he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often
            as he does so—even so did Hector go about among the army of warriors exhorting his men,
            [50] and cheering them on to cross the trench. </p>
          <p>But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink, for the width
            frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross it, for it had overhanging banks
            all round [55] upon either side, above which there were the sharp stakes that the sons
            of the Achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defense against all who would
            assail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, but
            those who were on foot kept trying their very utmost. [60] Then Polydamas went up to
            bold Hector and said, “Hector, and you other chiefs of the Trojans and allies, it is
            madness for us to try and drive our fast-footed horses across the trench; it will be
            very hard to cross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall.
            [65] Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they did;
            moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm. If, indeed, great Zeus is
            minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would
            myself gladly see [70] them perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally
            and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will be not so
            much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. [75] Now, therefore, let us all do
            as I say; let our attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] hold our
            horses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in full armor,
            and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand
            us.”</p>
          <p>[80] Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased radiant Hector, <seg rend="subscript"
              >81</seg> and straightaway he leapt out of his chariot, armor and all, hitting the
            ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw him do so, also left their chariots.
            Each man then gave his horses over to his charioteer in charge [85] to hold them in good
            order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>] for him at the trench. Then they
            formed themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed
            their leaders. Those that went with Hector and Polydamas the blameless were the bravest
            and most in number, and the most determined [90] to break through the wall and fight at
            the ships. Kebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hector had left
            his chariot in charge of a less valiant warrior. The next company was led by Paris,
            Alkathoös, and Agenor; the third by Helenos and godlike Deiphobos, [95] two sons of
            Priam, and with them was the hero Asios—Asios the son of Hyrtakos, whose great black
            horses of the breed that comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe.
            Aeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor, [100]
            Arkhelokhos and Akamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon was chief over
            the allies, and took with him Glaukos and warlike Asteropaios whom he thought most
            valiant after himself—for he was far the best man of them all. [105] These helped to
            array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the Danaans,
            for they felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that they should themselves
            now fall upon the ships. </p>
          <p>The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel of blameless
            Polydamas but [110] Asios son of Hyrtakos would not leave his horses and his attendant
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] behind him; in his foolhardiness he took
            them on with him towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.
            [115] Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilion, exulting in his chariot and his
            horses; before he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him and he had
            fallen by the spear of Idomeneus, the noble son of Deukalion. He had driven towards the
            left wing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with their chariots and
            horses from the plain. [120] In this direction he drove and found the gates with their
            doors opened wide, and the great bar down—for the gatemen kept them open so as to let
            those of their comrades enter who might be fleeing towards the ships. Here of set
            purpose did he direct his horses, and his men followed him [125] with a loud cry, for
            they felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they should now
            fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at the gates they should find two of the
            bravest chieftains, proud sons of the spear-fighting Lapiths—the one, powerful
            Polypoites, mighty son of Perithoös, [130] and the other Leonteus, peer of
            manslaughtering Arēs. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the
            mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle with
            wind and rain—even so did [135] these two men await the onset of great Asios confidently
            and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and by Iamenos, Orestes, [140] Adamas, the
            son of Asios, Thoön and Oinomaos, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the
            wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the two
            defenders remained inside and cheered the strong-greaved Achaeans on to stand firm in
            the defense of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were attacking the
            wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help and being routed, [145] they rushed
            outside and fought in front of the gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that
            abide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all
            round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering of their tusks,
            [150] till some one hits them and makes an end of them—even so did the gleaming bronze
            rattle about their breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with great
            fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These
            threw great stones at their assailants [155] in defense of themselves their tents and
            their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow that some fierce blast drives
            from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets upon the earth—even so fell the weapons
            from the hands alike of Trojans and Achaeans. [160] Helmet and shield rang out as the
            great stones rained upon them, and Asios the son of Hyrtakos in his dismay cried aloud
            and smote his two thighs. “Father Zeus,” he cried, “Truly you too are altogether given
            [165] to lying. I made sure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like
            slim-waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside—they leave
            not the holes wherein they have built undefended, [170] but fight for their little ones
            against all who would take them—even so these men, though they be but two, will not be
            driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be slain.” </p>
          <p>He spoke, but moved not the mind of Zeus, whose counsel it then was to give glory to
            Hector. [175] Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting about the other gates; I,
            however, am no god to be able to tell about all these things, for the battle raged
            everywhere about the stone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited
            though they were, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defending
            [180] the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapiths kept on fighting with might and
            main. </p>
          <p>Then Polypoites, mighty son of Perithoös, hit Damasos with a spear upon his
            cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for the point of the spear [185]
            went through it, and broke the bone, so that the brain inside was scattered about, and
            he died fighting. He then slew Pylon and Ormenos. Leonteus, of the lineage of Arēs,
            killed Hippomakhos, the son of Antimakhos, by striking him with his spear upon the belt.
            [190] He then drew his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat,
            and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenos, and Orestes,
            and laid them low one after the other.</p>
          <p>[195] While they were busy stripping the armor from these heroes, the youths who were
            led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater part and the most valiant of
            those that were trying to break through the wall and fire the ships) were still standing
            by the trench, uncertain what they should do; [200] for they had seen a sign from the
            gods when they had essayed to cross it—a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left wing
            of their army of warriors, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons still alive
            and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting
            itself backwards till it struck the bird that held it, [205] on the neck and breast;
            whereon the bird being in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the army of
            warriors, and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck with
            terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus, writhing in the midst of
            them, [210] and Polydamas went up to Hector and said, “Hector, at our councils of war
            you are ever given to rebuke me, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well
            that one of the population [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] should cross your
            will either in the field or in the council; you would have them support you always:
            [215] nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight
            the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which
            skirted the left wing of our army [220] with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons
            (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen to the Trojans on their
            essaying to cross the trench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking
            it home to her little ones, and so will it be—with ourselves; even though by a mighty
            effort we break through the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they give way before us,
            [225] still we shall not return in good order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >kosmos</foreign>] by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind us whom the
            Achaeans will do to death in defense of their ships. <seg rend="subscript">228</seg>thus
            would a seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theopropos</foreign>] respond [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">hupokrinesthai</foreign>]  who was expert in these matters, and was
            trusted by the people.”</p>
          <p>[230] Tall Hector of the shining helmet looked fiercely at him and said, “Polydamas, I
            like not of your reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will. If,
            however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed have the gods robbed you of your
            reason. [235] You would have me pay no heed to the counsels of thunderous Zeus, nor to
            the promises he made me—and he bowed his head in confirmation; you bid me be ruled
            rather by the flight of wild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark,
            [240] and whether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in
            the counsel of great Zeus, king of mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one
            only—that a man should fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? [245] Though we be
            all of us slain at the ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself,
            for you are not steadfast nor courageous. If you will not fight, or would talk others
            over from doing so, [250] you shall fall right away before my spear.” </p>
          <p>With these words he led the way, and the others followed after with a cry that rent the
            air. Then Zeus, the lord of thunder, sent the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains
            of Ida, that bore the dust down towards the ships; he thus lulled the thinking [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] [255] of the Achaeans into security, and gave victory
            to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their own might and to the signs he had
            shown them, essayed to break through the great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the
            breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the battlements; they heaved up the
            buttresses, which the Achaeans [260] had set in front of the wall in order to support
            it; when they had pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall, but the
            Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still fenced the battlements with
            their shields of ox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any
            came below the wall. </p>
          <p>[265] The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the Achaeans,
            giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any one whom they saw to be
              remiss. <seg rend="subscript">269</seg> “My dear friends! You who are top-rank among
            the Argives, and you who are middle-rank, [270] and you who are of lower rank—I say this
            because it has never yet happened that all men are equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >homoioi</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">271</seg> as men in war—now is the time when
            everybody has work to do. See that you none of you turn in flight towards the ships,
            daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward and keep one another in heart,
            [275] if it may so be that Olympian Zeus the lord of lightning will grant that we repel
            our foes, and drive them back towards the city.”</p>
          <p>Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As the flakes that
            fall thick upon a winter’s day, when Zeus is minded [280] to snow and to display these
            his arrows to humankind—he lulls the wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has
            buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy
            plains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens
            of the gray sea, [285] but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it can come no
            further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the skies with snow—
            even thus thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the
            Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was in an
            uproar. </p>
          <p>[290] Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down the gates and
            the great bar, had not Zeus turned his son Sarpedon against the Argives as a lion
            against a herd of horned cattle. Before him he held his shield [295] of hammered bronze,
            that the smith had beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox-hides which he had
            made fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of him, and
            brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long
            [300] famished for want of meat and will dare break even into a well-fenced homestead to
            try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with
            dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try
            for it; [305] he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit by a spear
            from strong hand—even so was godlike Sarpedon bent on attacking the wall and break down
            its battlements. Then he said to Glaukos, son of Hippolokhos, [310] “ Glaukos, why is it
            that you and I get the most honor [verb from <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] of
              all, <seg rend="subscript">311</seg> with a special place to sit, with choice meats,
            and with full wine-cups, <seg rend="subscript">312</seg> in Lycia, and everyone looks at
            us as gods, <seg rend="subscript">313</seg> and we are allotted a great sector of land
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">temenos</foreign>] at the banks of the Xanthos, <seg
              rend="subscript">314</seg> fine land, orchard and wheat-bearing ploughland? [315] And
            so it is our duty to take our stand in the front ranks of the Lycians, <seg
              rend="subscript">316</seg> and to meet blazing battle head-on, <seg rend="subscript"
              >317</seg> so that one of the heavily armored Lycians may say of us: <seg
              rend="subscript">318</seg> ‘Indeed it is not without <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign> that our kings <seg rend="subscript">319</seg> are lords of Lycia,
            who feed upon fat sheep [320] and drink choice sweet wine, since they have genuine
              strength <seg rend="subscript">321</seg> and since they fight in the front ranks of
            the Lycians.’ My good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could escape
            old age and death thenceforward and for ever, I should neither press forward myself
            [325] nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and
            no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or
            yield it to another.” </p>
          <p>Glaukos heeded his saying, [330] and the pair right away led on the army of Lycians.
            Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for it was against his part of
            the wall that they came—bringing destruction with them; he looked along the wall for
            some chieftain to support his comrades [335] and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for
            the fray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but he could
            not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from crashing
            shields and helmets [340] and the battering of gates with a din which reached the skies.
            For all the gates had been closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and
            break their way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thoötes with a message to
            Ajax. “Run, good Thoötes,” he said, “and call Ajax, or better still bid both come, [345]
            for it will be all over with us here directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon us,
            men who have ever fought desperately heretofore. But if they have too much labor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] on their hands to let them come, at any
            rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, [350] and let Teucer, the famous bowman, come with
            him.” </p>
          <p>The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall of the Achaeans.
            When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, “Sirs, princes of the Argives, [355] the son
            of noble Peteos bids you come to him for a while and help him. You had better both come
            if you can, or it will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are
            upon him, men who [360] have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have too much on
            your hands to let both come, at any rate let powerful Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let
            Teucer the famous bowman come with him.” </p>
          <p>Great Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, [365] and at once spoke to the son of
            Oïleus. “Ajax,” said he, “do you two, yourself and brave Lykomedes, stay here and keep
            the Danaans in heart to fight their hardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in
            the fray, but I will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help they
            need.”</p>
          <p>[370] With this, Ajax, son of Telamon, set off, and Teucer, his brother by the same
            father, went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer’s bow. They went along inside the wall,
            and when they came to the tower where high-hearted Menestheus was (and hard pressed
            indeed did they find him) [375] the brave chiefs and leaders of the Lycians were
            storming the battlements as it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and
            raising the battle-cry aloud. </p>
          <p>First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epikles, a comrade of Sarpedon, [380] hitting
            him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the very top of the wall. As men
            now are, even one who is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two hands,
            but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing Epikles’ four-crested helmet
            [385] so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high
            wall as though he were diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded
            Glaukos the brave son of Hippolokhos as he was coming on to attack the wall. He saw his
            shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaukos leave off fighting. [390]
            Then he sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that he was wounded
            and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]
            when he saw Glaukos leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed his spear
            at Alkmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. [395] He drew his spear back again Alkmaon
            came down headlong after it with his bronzed armor rattling round him. Then Sarpedon
            seized the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it gave way, and a
            breach was made through which many might pass. </p>
          <p>[400] Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with an arrow on
            the band that bore the shield which covered his body, but Zeus saved his son from
            destruction that he might not fall by the ships’ sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him
            and pierced his shield, but the spear [405] did not go clean through, though it hustled
            him back that he could come on no further. He therefore retired a little space from the
            battlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself
            with glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians saying, “Lycians, why
            do you thus fail me? [410] For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a
            way to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are of us
            the better.” </p>
          <p>The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was their counselor and
            their king. [415] The Argives on their part got their men in fighting order within the
            wall, and there was a deadly struggle between them. The Lycians could not break through
            the wall and force their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians [420]
            from the wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods in hand,
            quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for their
            rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the battlements now serve as a
            bone of contention, [425] and they beat one another’s round shields for their
            possession. Many a man’s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round
            and bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through their shields; [430]
            the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with the blood alike of Trojans and of
            Achaeans. But even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as
            some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales be
            true [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">alēthēs</foreign>], [435] for she would gain some pitiful
            earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenly between them till
            the time came when Zeus gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first to
            spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans,
            [440] “Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their
            ships.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at the wall as he had
            bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp spears in their hands. [445] Hector
            laid hold of a stone that lay just outside the gates and was thick at one end but
            pointed at the other; two of the best men in a local population [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], the kind of men who exist now, could hardly raise it
            from the ground and put it on to a wagon, but Hector lifted it quite easily by himself,
            [450] for the son of scheming Kronos made it light for him. As a shepherd picks up a
            ram’s fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great
            stone and drive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set.
            [455] These doors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to which
            there was but one key. When he had got close up to them, Hector strode towards them that
            his blow might gain in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight
            against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell [460] inside by reason of its
            great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and the
            doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through the force of the blow.
            Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face as dark as that of fleeing night. The
            gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had two spears [465] in his hand.
            None but a god could have withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his
            eyes glared like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them to
            scale the wall, and they did as he bade them—some of them at once climbing over the
            wall, while others passed [470] through the gates. The Danaans then fled panic-stricken
            towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.</p>

          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now when Zeus had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the
            ships, he left them to their never-ending toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"

            horse-breeders of Thrace, [5] the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble
            Hippemolgoi, who live on milk, and the Abians, most just of humankind. He no longer
            turned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any of the immortals
            would go and help either Trojans or Danaans.</p>
          <p>[10] But King Poseidon had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking admiringly on
            the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded Samothrace, whence he could see
            all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships of the Achaeans. [15] He had come from
            under the sea and taken his place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being
            overcome by the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Zeus. </p>
          <p>Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he strode swiftly
            onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath the tread of his immortal feet.
            [20] Three strides he took, and with the fourth he reached his goal— <seg

            he stepped on the platform of his chariot, <seg rend="subscript">27</seg> and off he
            went over the waves, and the sea creatures were frolicking underneath as we went

              >31</seg> as he [= Poseidon] was being conveyed toward the ships of the Achaeans by

            hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could either unloose or break, so
            that they might stay there in that place until their lord should return. This done he
            went his way to the army of the Achaeans.</p>
          <p>Now the Trojans [40] followed Hector, son of Priam, in close array like a storm-cloud
            or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising the cry battle; for they
            thought that they should take the ships of the Achaeans and kill all their chief heroes
            then and there. Meanwhile earth-encircling Poseidon, lord of the earthquake, cheered on
            the Argives, for he had come up out of the sea [45] and had assumed the form and voice
            of Kalkhas. </p>
          <p>First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already, and said, “Ajaxes,

              rend="subscript">54</seg> who boasts to be the child of mighty Zeus, is leading them
            on like a pillar of flame. May [55] some god, then, put it into your hearts to make a
            firm stand here, and to incite others to do the like. In this case you will drive him
            from the ships even though he be inspired by Zeus himself.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake [60] struck both of them with
            his scepter and filled their hearts with daring. He made their legs light and active, as
            also their hands and their feet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high
            above some sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, [65]
            even so did Poseidon lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them.
            Of the two, swift Ajax, son of Oïleus, was the first to know who it was that had been
            speaking with them, and said to Ajax, son of Telamon, “Ajax, this is one of the gods
            that dwell on Olympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by
            our ships. [70] It was not Kalkhas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him at once by
            his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are soon recognized. Moreover I feel
            the lust of battle burn more fiercely within me, [75] while my hands and my feet under
            me are more eager for the fray.”</p>
          <p>And Ajax, son of Telamon, answered, “I too feel my hands grasp my spear more firmly; my
            strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long, moreover, to meet [80] furious
            Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which the god had
            filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the Achaeans, who were resting in the
            rear by the ships [85] overcome at once by hard fighting and by grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] at seeing that the Trojans had got over the wall in
            force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld them, for they made sure that
            they should not escape destruction; but the lord of the earthquake [90] passed lightly
            about among them and urged their battalions to the front. </p>
          <p>First he went up to Teucer and Leitos, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas and Deipyros;
            Meriones also and Antilokhos, valiant warriors; all did he exhort. [95] “Shame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] on you young Argives,” he cried, “it was on your
            prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might and main, this
            very day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Truly my eyes behold a great [100] and
            terrifying portent which I had never thought to see—the Trojans at our ships—they, who
            were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest,
            with no strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves. [105] Up to now the
            Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have come
            out far from their city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice of our
            leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in their discontent care not
            to fight in defense [110] of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King
            Agamemnon, son of Atreus, is responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>] for
            our disaster by having insulted the swift-footed son of Peleus, still this is no reason
            why we should leave off fighting. [115] Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the
            brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest warriors in
            our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am
            indignant with such men as you are. [120] My good friends, matters will soon become even
            worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honor [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] and deservedness [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >nemesis</foreign>], for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now
            fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt that held
            them.”</p>
          <p>[125] Thus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on. Then round
            the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, whom not even Arēs nor Athena,
            marshalers of armies, could disregard if they went among them, for they were the chosen
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] men of all those who were now awaiting
            the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made a living fence, [130] spear to spear,
            shield to shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair
            crests on their gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely
            aligned were they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced,
            [135] and their hearts were set on battle. The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with
            Hector at their head pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of
            some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations of the
            dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, [140] and as it bounds headlong on its
            way it sets the whole forest in an uproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it
            reaches level ground, but then for all its fury it can go no further—even so easily did
            Hector for a while seem as though he would career through the tents and ships of the
            Achaeans till he had reached the sea [145] in his murderous course; but the closely
            serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust
            at him with swords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them so that he
            staggered and gave ground; then he shouted to the Trojans, [150] “Trojans, Lycians, and
            Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a
            wall against me, but they will not check me for long; they will give ground before me if
            the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Hera, has indeed inspired my
            onset.”</p>
          <p>[155] With these words he put heart and spirit into them all. Deiphobos, son of Priam,
            went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his round shield before him, under
            cover of which he strode quickly forward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, [160]
            nor did he fail to hit the broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the
            spear broke in two pieces long before he could do so; moreover Deiphobos had seen it
            coming and had held his shield well away from him. The high-spirited Meriones [165] drew
            back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish Deiphobos,
            and having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a
            spear that he had left behind in his tent. </p>
          <p>The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into the sky. [170]
            Teucer, son of Telamon, was the first to kill his man, to wit, the warrior Imbrios, son
            of Mentor, rich in horses. Until the Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaion, and had
            married Medesikaste a bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet
            he had gone back [175] to Ilion, and was a great man among the Trojans, dwelling near
            Priam himself, who gave him like honor with his own sons. The son of Telamon now struck
            him under the ear with a spear which he then drew back again, and Imbrios fell headlong
            as an ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, [180] and
            its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his
            bronze-wrought armor ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to
            strip him of his armor; but as he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear.
            Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, [185] whereon it hit great-hearted
            Amphimakhos, son of Kteatos, son of Aktor, in the chest as he was coming into battle,
            and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang
            forward to take Amphimakhos’ helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax [190]
            threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all over in his
            terrifying armor; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his shield with such force
            as to drive him back from the two corpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. [195]
            Stikhios and radiant Menestheus, chiefs of the Athenians, bore away Amphimakhos to the
            army of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by Imbrios.
            As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in their fangs, [200] and bear
            it through thick brushwood high above the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear
            aloft the body of Imbrios, and strip it of its armor. Then the son of Oïleus severed the
            head from the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimakhos, and sent it whirling over
            the crowd as though it had been a ball, [205] till it fell in the dust at Hector’s
            feet. </p>
          <p>Poseidon was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimakhos should have fallen; he
            therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further,
            and to devise evil for the Trojans. [210] Idomeneus the spear-famed met him, as he was
            taking leave of a comrade, who had just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee.
            His fellow-warriors bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the
            physicians went on to his tent, [215] for he was still thirsting for battle. Poseidon
            spoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas, son of Andraimon, who ruled the
            Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, <seg rend="subscript">218</seg> and he got
            honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] in the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>], like a god. “Idomeneus,” said he, “lawgiver to the Cretans, what
            has now become of the threats [220] with which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten
            the Trojans?” </p>
          <p>And Idomeneus, chief among the Cretans, answered, “Thoas, no one, so far as I know, is
            responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>], for we can all fight. None are
            held back neither by fear [225] nor slackness, but it seems to be the will of almighty
            Zeus that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you, Thoas, have
            been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if you see any fail in duty; [230] be
            not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their utmost.” </p>
          <p>To this Poseidon, lord of the earthquake, made answer, “Idomeneus, may he never return
            from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon, who is this day willfully slack in
            fighting. [235] Get your armor and go, we must make all haste together if we may be of
            any use, though we are only two. Even cowards get a share of excellence [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] from companionship, and we two can hold our own with
            the bravest.”</p>
          <p>[240] Then the god went back into the thick of the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>], and Idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armor,
            grasped his two spears, and went forth. As the lightning which the son of Kronos
            brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a sign [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign>] to mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide— [245] even so did his
            armor gleam about him as he ran. Meriones, his sturdy attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>], met him while he was still near his tent (for he
            was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said </p>
          <p>“Meriones, fleet son of Molos, best of [250] comrades, why have you left the field? Are
            you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you? Or have you been sent to fetch
            me? I want no fetching; I had far rather fight than stay in my tent.”</p>
          <p>“Idomeneus,” answered Meriones, [255] “I come for a spear, if I can find one in my
            tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the shield of Deiphobos.” </p>
          <p>And Idomeneus chief of the bronze-armored Cretans answered, [260] “You will find one
            spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of my tent. I have
            taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am not one to keep my enemy at arm’s
            length; therefore I have spears, bossed shields, [265] helmets, and burnished
            chest-armor.” </p>
          <p>Then Meriones said, “I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken from the
            Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times valorous [270], and wherever
            there has been hard fighting have held my own among the foremost. There may be those
            among the Achaeans who do not know how I fight, but you know it well enough
            yourself.” </p>
          <p>Idomeneus answered, [275] “I know you for a man of excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aretē</foreign>]: you need not tell me. If the best men at the ships were being
            chosen to go on an ambush—and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made
            of; it comes out then who is cowardly and who is of excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aretē</foreign>]; the coward will change color at every touch and turn; [280] he is
            full of fears, and keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other;
            his heart beats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his
            teeth; whereas the brave man will not change color nor be [285] frightened on finding
            himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into action—if the best men were
            being chosen for such a service, no one could make light of your courage nor feats of
            arms. If you were struck by a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from
            behind, in your neck nor back, [290] but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly
            as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let us no longer stay
            here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent
            at once.” </p>
          <p>[295] Then Meriones, peer of manslaughtering Arēs, went to the tent and got himself a
            spear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valor. As
            when baneful Arēs rushes forth to battle, and his son Panic, so strong [300] and
            dauntless, goes with him, to strike terror even into the heart of a hero—the pair have
            gone from Thrace to arm themselves among the Ephyroi or the brave Phlegyai, but they
            will not listen to both the contending armies of warriors, and will give victory to one
            side or to the other—even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, chiefs of men, [305] go out to
            battle clad in their bronze armor. Meriones was first to speak. “Son of Deukalion,” said
            he, “where would you have us begin fighting? On the right wing of the army of warriors,
            in the center, or on the left wing, [310] where I take it the flowing-haired Achaeans
            will be weakest?”</p>
          <p>Idomeneus answered, “There are others to defend the center—the two Ajaxes and Teucer,
            who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight.
            [315] These will give Hector son of Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it
            hard to vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Kronos
            [320] fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax, son of Telamon, will
            yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Demeter, if bronze and
            great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to Achilles [325] in
            hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none to beat him. <seg
              rend="subscript">326</seg>You [= Mērionēs] must keep the two of us [= Mērionēs and
            Idomeneus] to the left—just like this!—of the battleground, that we may know right away
            whether we are to give glory to some other, or he to us.”</p>
          <p>Meriones, peer of fleet Arēs, then led the way till they came to the part of the army
            of warriors which Idomeneus had named. </p>
          <p>[330] Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, him and his
            attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] clad in their richly wrought
            armor, they shouted and made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight
            raged under the ships’ sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle [335] upon a day
            when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it into a thick cloud—even such
            was the fury of the combat, and might and main did they hack at each other with spear
            and sword throughout the army of warriors. The field bristled with the long [340] and
            deadly spears which they bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their
            fresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined battle with one
            another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in the sight of such a
            turmoil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>], and look on it without being
            dismayed.</p>
          <p>[345] Thus did the two mighty sons of Kronos devise evil for mortal heroes. Zeus was
            minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as to do honor to fleet
            Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean army of warriors
            before Ilion, [350] and only wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Poseidon on
            the other hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having come up from the gray
            sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was
            furiously angry with Zeus. Both were of the same lineage and country, [355] but Zeus was
            elder born and knew more, therefore Poseidon feared to defend the Argives openly, but in
            the likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout their army of warriors.
            Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle, that none [360] could unloose
            or break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men’s knees beneath
            them. </p>
          <p>And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with gray, called loud on the
            Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he leaped in among them. He slew
            Othryoneus from Kabesos, a sojourner, who had but lately come to take part in the glory
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]. [365] He sought Kassandra the fairest of
            Priam’s daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts of wooing, for he promised a great
            thing, to wit, that he would drive the sons of the Achaeans against their will from
            Troy; old King Priam had given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on
            the strength of the promises thus made to him. [370] Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit
            him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear
            stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus boasted over
            him saying, “Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do
            you, [375] if you indeed perform what you have promised Priam, son of Dardanos, in
            return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will give you the loveliest
            daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you
            [380] will destroy the goodly city of Ilion in company with ourselves; so come along
            with me, that we may make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we will not be
            hard upon you about gifts of wooing.”</p>
          <p>With this the hero Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick of the
            fight, but Asios came up to protect the body, [385] on foot, in front of his horses
            which his attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] drove so close behind
            him that he could feel their breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike down
            Idomeneus, but before he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his spear in the throat
            under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it. He fell as an oak, or
            poplar, [390] or pine which shipwrights have felled for ship’s timber upon the mountains
            with whetted axes—even thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,
            grinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained dust. His charioteer was struck
            with panic [395] and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereupon stubborn
            Antilokhos hit him in the middle of his body with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not
            protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot [400]
            and Antilokhos, great-hearted Nestor’s son, drove his horses from the Trojans to the
            strong-greaved Achaeans. </p>
          <p>Deiphobos then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asios, and took aim at him with a
            spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided it, [405] for he was covered by the
            round shield he always bore—a shield of ox-hide and bronze with two arm-rods on the
            inside. He crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield
            rang out as the spear grazed it, [410] and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong
            hand of Deiphobos, for it struck Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, shepherd of his people, in
            the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobos boasted over
            him and cried with a loud voice saying, “Truly Asios has not fallen unavenged; [415] he
            will be glad even while passing into the house of Hādēs, strong warden of the gate, that
            I have sent some one to escort him.”</p>
          <p>Thus did he boast, and the Argives felt grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >akhos</foreign>] at his saying. Noble Antilokhos was more angry than anyone, but grief
            did not make him forget his friend and comrade. [420] He ran up to him, bestrode him,
            and covered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mekisteus, son of
            Ekhios, and radiant Alastor stooped down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the
              ships. <seg rend="subscript">424</seg>Idomeneus did not fail in his great <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>, and he was roused all the time [425] either to
            enshroud some Trojan in the darkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the
            evil day from the Achaeans. Then fell Alkathoös, son of noble Aisyetes: he was
            son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia [430] who was the
            darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation in beauty,
            accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest man in all Troy had taken her
            to wife—him did Poseidon lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, [435] blinding his bright
            eyes and binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one
            side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him with a
            spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail [440] that had up to now protected
            his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear tore through it. He fell heavily
            to the ground, and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end
            of the spear quiver till dread Arēs put an end to his life. [445] Idomeneus boasted over
            him and cried with a loud voice saying, “Deiphobos, since you are in a mood to boast,
            shall we cry quits now that we have killed three men to your one? No, sir, stand in
            fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Zeus-begotten man am I that
            have come here. [450] Zeus first begot Minos, chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his
            turn begot a son, noble Deukalion; Deukalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in
            Crete, and my ships have now brought me here, to be the bane of yourself, your father,
            and the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>[455] Thus did he speak, and Deiphobos was in two minds, whether to go back and fetch
            some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge single-handed. In the end, he
            thought it best to go and fetch Aeneas. <seg rend="subscript">459</seg> And he found him
            standing hindmost in the battle, [460] for he had anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mēnis</foreign>] always against brilliant Priam, <seg rend="subscript"
            >461</seg> because he [Priam] did not honor him [Aeneas], worthy that he was among
            heroes. Deiphobos went up to him and said, “Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you
            know any ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister’s husband; [465]
            come with me to the rescue of Alkathoös, who being husband to your sister brought you up
            when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.” </p>
          <p>With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit of Idomeneus, big
            with great deeds of valor; [470] but Idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he
            were a mere child; he held his ground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who
            abides the coming of a great crowd of men in some lonely place—the bristles stand
            upright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks [475] in his eagerness
            to defend himself against hounds and men—even so did spear-famed Idomeneus hold his
            ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud to his comrades looking
            towards Askalaphos, Aphareus, Deipyros, Meriones, and Antilokhos, all of them brave
            warriors— [480] “This way, my friends,” he cried, “and leave me not single-handed—I go
            in great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a terrifying dispenser
            of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man’s strength is
            greatest; [485] if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind, either he or I
            should soon bear away the prize of victory.” </p>
          <p>Then, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder. Aeneas on the other
            side called to his comrades, [490] looking towards Deiphobos, Paris, and radiant Agenor,
            who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself, and the people followed them as
            sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been feeding, and the
            heart of the shepherd is glad—even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened [495] when he
            saw his people follow him. </p>
          <p>Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alkathoös, wielding their
            long spears; and the bronze armor about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at
            one another in the press of the fight, while the two heroes [500] Aeneas and Idomeneus,
            peers of Arēs, outdid every one in their desire to hack at each other with sword and
            spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided the spear,
            [505] so that it sped from Aeneas’ strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in the
            ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oinomaos in the middle of his belly, and broke the
            plate of his chest-armor, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth
            in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear out
            of the body, [510] but could not strip him of the rest of his armor for the rain of
            darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him
            so that he could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recover his own
            weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still
            defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, [515] his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly
            out of the battle. Deiphobos aimed a spear at him as he was retreating slowly from the
            field, for his bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again he missed him,
            and hit Askalaphos, the son of Arēs; the spear went [520] through his shoulder, and he
            clutched the earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. </p>
          <p>Grim Arēs of terrifying voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, for <seg
              rend="subscript">523</seg>he was on a peak of Olympus, amidst golden clouds. <seg
              rend="subscript">524</seg> He was sitting there, all wrapped up in the plans [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">boulai</foreign>] of Zeus,where the other [525] gods were also
            sitting, forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the
            body. Deiphobos tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang upon him, and
            struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored [530] helmet fell from his hand
            and came ringing down upon the ground. Then Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture,
            drew the spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites,
            own brother of Deiphobos passed his arms around his waist, [535] and bore him away from
            the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear of the fight with
            the chariot and their driver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great
            pain, with the blood flowing from his arm.</p>
          <p>[540] The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to the sky without ceasing.
            Aeneas sprang on Aphareus, son of Kaletor, and struck him with a spear in his throat
            which was turned towards him; his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down
            along with him, and death, life’s foe, was shed around him. [545] Antilokhos spied his
            chance, flew forward towards Thoön, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid
            open the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean away
            throughout its whole course, and Thoön fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his
            hands imploringly towards his comrades. [550] Antilokhos sprang upon him and stripped
            the armor from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans came
            about him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, but could not wound
            his body, for Poseidon [555] stood guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell
            thickly round him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the
            fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was
            he to hit some one from a distance or to fight him hand to hand. </p>
          <p>[560] As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son of Asios, who
            rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle of his shield, but Poseidon
            made its point without effect, for he grudged him the life of Antilokhos. One half,
            therefore, of the spear stuck fast like a charred stake [565] in Antilokhos’ shield,
            while the other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,
            but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts
            and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to wretched mortals. [570] There
            did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed convulsively about the spear as some bull whom
            mountain herdsmen have bound with ropes of willow and are taking away perforce. Even so
            did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till fighting Meriones came
            up and drew the spear [575] out of his body, and his eyes were veiled in darkness. </p>
          <p>Helenos then struck Deipyros with a great Thracian sword, hitting him on the temple in
            close combat and tearing the helmet from his head; the helmet fell to the ground, and
            one of those who were fighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his
            feet, [580] but the eyes of Deipyros were closed in the darkness of death. </p>
          <p>Then Menelaos of the great war-cry felt grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >akhos</foreign>], and made menacingly towards Helenos, brandishing his spear; but
            Helenos drew his bow, and the two attacked one another at one and the same moment, the
            one with his spear, [585] and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the
            plate of Menelaos’ chest-armor, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black beans or
            pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, [590]
            blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel—even so did the arrow glance off and
            recoil from the shield of glorious Menelaos, who in his turn wounded the hand with which
            Helenos carried his bow; the spear [595] went right through his hand and stuck in the
            bow itself, so that to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand
            dragging by his side—for the spear weighed it down till great-hearted Agenor drew it out
            and bound the hand carefully up [600] in a woolen sling which his attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] had with him. </p>
          <p>Peisandros then made straight at Menelaos the glorious—his evil destiny luring him on
            to his doom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>], for he was to fall in fight with
            you, O Menelaos. When the two were hard by one another [605] the spear of the son of
            Atreus turned aside and he missed his aim; Peisandros then struck the shield of brave
            Menelaos but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the spear and broke the shaft;
            nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory; [610] right away, however, the son of
            Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him. Peisandros then seized the bronze battle-axe,
            with its long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,
            and the two made at one another. Peisandros struck the peak of Menelaos’ crested helmet
            [615] just under the crest itself, and Menelaos hit Peisandros as he was coming towards
            him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two
            gore-dripping eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and
            Menelaos set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armor, and boasted over him saying,
            [620] “Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate
            of battle though you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have
            heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you in your hearts  <seg
              rend="subscript">624</seg> did not fear the harsh anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mēnis</foreign>] of Zeus, the roar of whose thunder is enormous. [625] As the
            god-of-hosting-guests [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">xenios</foreign>], he will at some point
            destroy your lofty city; you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure
            when you were her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our
            heroes. [630] A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O father Zeus,
            you, whom they say are above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things
            that befall us do proceed, how can you thus favor the Trojans—men so proud and
            overweening, that they are never [635] tired of fighting? All things pall after a
            while—sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance—still these are things of which a man
            would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of battle that the
            Trojans are insatiate.”</p>
          <p>[640] So saying blameless Menelaos stripped the bloodstained armor from the body of
            Peisandros, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself among those who
            were in the front of the fight.</p>
          <p>Harpalion son of King Pylaimenes then sprang upon him; he had come to fight at Troy
            along with his father, [645] but he did not go home again. He struck the middle of
            Menelaos’ shield with his spear but could not pierce it, and to save his life drew back
            under cover of his men, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. [650]
            But Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hit him
            on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and through, and penetrated the
            bladder, so he sat down where he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades,
            stretched like a worm [655] upon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that
            flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they raised
            him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also
            with him weeping bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life
            again.</p>
          <p>[660] Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host when he went
            among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in order to avenge him. Now there
            was a certain man named Eukhenor, son of Polyidos the prophet [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mantis</foreign>], a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. [665] This
            Eukhenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would be the death of him, for his
            good old father Polyidos had often told him that he must either stay at home and die of
            a terrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he
            chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans [670] would have laid
            upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now
            smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was
            enshrouded in the darkness of death. </p>
          <p>Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector beloved of Zeus had not
            yet heard, and did not know [675] that the Argives were making havoc of his men on the
            left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans before long would have triumphed over them,
            so vigorously did Poseidon cheer them on and help them. He therefore held on at the
            point where he had first forced his way through the gates [680] and the wall, after
            breaking through the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of
            Ajax and Protesilaos were drawn up by the seashore; here the wall was at its lowest, and
            the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely. [685] The Boeotians and the Ionians
            with their long khitons, the Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the
            Epeioi could hardly stay flame-like Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could
            they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the Athenians
            were in the van, [690] led by Menestheus, son of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas,
            Stikhios, and stalwart Bias: Meges, son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Drakios commanded the
            Epeioi, while Medon and staunch Podarkes led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was
            bastard son to Oïleus the godlike [695] and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylake
            away from his own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, the
            wife of Oïleus; the other, Podarkes, was the son of Iphiklos, son of Phylakos. These two
            stood in the van of the great-hearted Phthians, [700] and defended the ships along with
            the Boeotians. </p>
          <p>Swift Ajax son of Oïleus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of Telamon, but
            as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plow which they are drawing in a
            fallow field, [705] and the sweat steams upwards from about the roots of their
            horns—nothing but the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the
            end of the field—even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another.
            Many and brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, [710] to relieve him of his shield
            when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close after
            the great-hearted son of Oïleus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-hand
            fight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, [715] neither had they
            shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of
            twisted wool from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans.
            The others, therefore, with their heavy armor bore the brunt of the fight [720] with the
            Trojans and with Hector the brazen-helmed, while the Locrians shot from behind, under
            their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows threw them into
            confusion. </p>
          <p>The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships and tents back to
            windy Ilion, [725] had not Polydamas presently said to bold Hector, <seg
              rend="subscript">726</seg> “Hector, there is no way you can be helped to heed
            persuasive words. <seg rend="subscript">727</seg> Just because the god granted that you
            excel in deeds of war <seg rend="subscript">728</seg> you wish also to excel in planning
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">boulē</foreign>] by knowing more than others. <seg
              rend="subscript">729</seg> But there is no way you can get everything all to yourself.
            [730] The god grants that one man excel in deeds of war <seg rend="subscript"
            >731</seg> and another in dancing and another in playing the lyre and singing. <seg
              rend="subscript">732</seg> And for yet another man, far-seeing Zeus places a wise
            understanding [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] in his breast, <seg
              rend="subscript">733</seg> a genuine one; and many men benefit from such a man, <seg
              rend="subscript">734</seg> and he saves many of them, and he himself has the greatest
            powers of recognition [verb <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">anagignōskō</foreign>] [735] But I
            will tell you what seems best to me. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of
            fire, and even now that the great-hearted Trojans are within the wall some of them stand
            aloof in full armor, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the ships.
            [740] Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that we may advise
            together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope that the gods may grant us
            victory, or to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear [745] that
            the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at
            their ships who is never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much longer.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. <seg rend="subscript"
              >749</seg> Straightaway he [= Hector] leapt out of his chariot, armor and all, hitting
            the ground, [750] and said, “Polydamas, gather the chieftains here; I will go yonder
            into the fight, but will return at once when I have given them their orders.” </p>
          <p>He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, [755] and with a loud cry flew
            through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they heard his voice they all
            hastened to gather round Polydamas, the excellent son of Panthoös, but Hector kept on
            among the foremost, looking everywhere to find Deiphobos and prince Helenos, Adamas, son
            of Asios, [760] and Asios, son of Hyrtakos; living, indeed, and unscathed he could no
            longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean ships, losing
            their life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] at the hands of the
            Argives, while the others had been also stricken and wounded by them; [765] but upon the
            left wing of the dread battle he found Alexandros, husband of lovely-haired Helen,
            cheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him.
            “Paris,” said he, “evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and false of tongue,
            [770] where are Deiphobos and King Helenos? Where are Adamas son of Asios, and Asios son
            of Hyrtakos? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilion is undone and will now surely fall!” </p>
          <p>Alexandros the godlike answered, [775] “Hector, why find fault when there is no one to
            find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather than this, for my
            mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. From the moment when you set our men
            fighting about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans.
            [780] Our comrades about whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobos and King Helenos alone have
            left the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Kronos saved them
            alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, [785] and we will follow with
            right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but
            no man can do more than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.” </p>
          <p>With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards the part of the
            battle where the fight was thickest, [790] about Kebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalkes,
            Orthaios, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys, son of Hippotion, who had
            come from fertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. Then Zeus urged
            them on to fight. [795] And they came, like a gust of the racking winds, <seg
              rend="subscript">796</seg> which under the thunderstroke of Father Zeus drives
              downward <seg rend="subscript">797</seg> and with gigantic clamor hits the sea, and
            the many <seg rend="subscript">798</seg> boiling waves along the length of the roaring
              sea <seg rend="subscript">799</seg> bend and whiten to foam in ranks, one upon the
            other— [800] even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armor follow
            their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector, son of Priam, peer of manslaughtering
            Arēs, with his round shield before him—his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of
            bronze— [805] and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under
            cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the ranks to see if they would
            give way to him, but he could not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first
            to stride out and challenge him. [810] “Sir,” he cried, “draw near; why do you think
            thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent warriors, but the scourge
            of Zeus has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart is set on destroying our ships, but we
            too have bands that can keep you at bay, [815] and your own fair town shall be sooner
            taken and destroyed by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Zeus and all the
            gods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than hawks [820] as they raise the
            dust on the plain and bear you back to your city.” </p>
          <p>As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the army of the
            Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But Hector answered, “Ajax, braggart
            and false of tongue, [825] if only I were the child of aegis-bearing Zeus <seg
              rend="subscript">826</seg> for all days to come, and the Lady Hera were my
              mother, <seg rend="subscript">827</seg> and if only I got <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign> just as Athena and Apollo get <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign> <seg rend="subscript">828</seg> —as surely as this day brings
            misfortune to the Argives. And you shall fall among them if you dare [830] abide my
            spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey with
            your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>With these words he led the way and the others followed after with a cry that rent the
            air, while the army of warriors shouted behind them. [835] The Argives on their part
            raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess, but stood firm against the
            onslaught of the bravest Trojan chieftains, and the cry from both the armies rose up to
            the sky and to the brightness of Zeus’ presence. </p>

          <head>Rhapsody 14</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Nestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not
            escape him, and he said to the son of Asklepios, “What, noble Makhaon, is the meaning of
            all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow stronger and stronger; [5] stay
            here, therefore, and sit over your wine, while fair Hekamede heats you a bath and washes
            the clotted blood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and see what
            it is all about.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes [10] that was lying in his
            tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken his father’s shield; he
            grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and as soon as he was outside saw the
            disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, now that their wall was overthrown, [15] were
            fleeing pell-mell before the Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but
            the waves are dumb—they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the fierce
            winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set neither this way nor
            that, till some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine them— [20] even so
            did the old man ponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of
            Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the
            armies were fighting and killing one another, [25] and the hard bronze rattled on their
            bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and spears. </p>
          <p>The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Odysseus, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus, fell on
            Nestor as they were coming up from their ships— [30] for theirs were drawn up some way
            from where the fighting was going on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had
            been beached first, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of
            the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the ships, and the army was
            cramped for space, [35] therefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind the
            other, and had filled the whole opening of the bay between the two points that formed
            it. The kings, leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in
            great anxiety, [40] and when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay. Then King
            Agamemnon said to him, “Nestor, son of Neleus, honor to the Achaean name, why have you
            left the battle to come hither? I fear that what dread Hector said will come true, [45]
            when he vaunted among the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilion till he had
            fired our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming true.
            Alas! others of the Achaeans, [50] like Achilles, are in anger with me that they refuse
            to fight by the sterns of our ships.” </p>
          <p>Then Nestor, horseman of Gerene, answered, “It is indeed as you say; it is all coming
            true at this moment, and even Zeus who thunders from on high cannot prevent it. [55]
            Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our
            fleet. The Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where
            you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; [60] they
            are being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think,
            if counsel can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going into
            battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded.” </p>
          <p>And King Agamemnon answered, [65] “Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting at the
            rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has served us—over which the
            Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for
            us and our fleet—I see it must be the will of Zeus [70] that the Achaeans should perish
            ingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Zeus was willing to defend us, and I know
            now that he is raising the Trojans to like honor with the gods, while us, on the other
            hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; [75] let us
            bring down the ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make
            them fast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night—if even by
            night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then draw down the rest of the
            fleet. [80] There is no sense of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nemesis</foreign> in fleeing
            ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should flee and be saved than be
            caught and killed.” </p>
          <p>Odysseus looked fiercely at him and said, “Son of Atreus, what are you talking about?
            Wretch, you should have commanded some other and baser army, [85] and not been ruler
            over us to whom Zeus has allotted a life of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we
            every one of us perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we
            have suffered so much hardship? [90] Hold your peace, lest some other of the Achaeans
            hear you say what no man who knows how to give good counsel, no king over so great an
            army as that of the Argives should ever have let fall from his lips. [95] I despise your
            judgment utterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our
            ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands of
            the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; [100] the Achaeans will not go on fighting
            when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep
            turning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir leader, would be our
            destruction.” </p>
          <p>Agamemnon answered, “Odysseus, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. [105] I am not,
            however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into the sea whether they will or no.
            Some one, it may be, old or young, can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to
            hear.” </p>
          <p>Then said Diomedes, [110] “Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if you will
            listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger than any of you. I am by
            lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies buried at Thebes. [115] For Portheus had
            three noble sons, two of whom, Agrios and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The
            third was the horseman Oeneus, my father’s father, and he was the most valorous of them
            all. Oeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as Zeus and the other gods
            ordained it) [120] migrated to Argos. He married into the family of Adrastos, and his
            house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of fertile grain-growing
            land, with much orchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all
            the Argives in the use of the spear. [125] You must yourselves have heard whether these
            things are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as though I were a
            coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must,
            wounded though we be. When there, we may keep out of the battle [130] and beyond the
            range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but we
            can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle
            hitherto.”</p>
          <p>Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out, King Agamemnon
            leading the way. </p>
          <p>[135] Meanwhile Poseidon had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in the
            semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon’s right hand in his own and said, “Son of
            Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now [140] that he sees the Achaeans routed and slain,
            for he is utterly without remorse—may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As
            for yourself, the blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the
            princes and counselors of the Trojans [145] shall again raise the dust upon the plain,
            and you shall see them fleeing from the ships and tents towards their city.” </p>
          <p>With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the plain. The voice
            that came from his deep chest was as that of nine or ten thousand men when they are
            shouting in the thick of a fight, [150] and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the
            Achaeans to wage war and do battle without ceasing. Hera of the golden throne looked
            down as she stood upon a peak of Olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him
            [155] who was at once her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither
            amid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Zeus as he sat on the topmost crests of
            many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself to think how she might trick his
            thinking, [160] and in the end she deemed that it would be best for her to go to Ida and
            array herself in rich attire, in the hope that Zeus might become enamored of her, and
            wish to embrace her. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made
            [165] to steal over his eyes and senses. </p>
          <p>She went, therefore, to the room which her son Hephaistos had made her, and the doors
            of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret key so that no other god could
            open them. Here she entered and closed the doors behind her. [170] She cleansed all the
            dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil,
            ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for herself—if it were so much as shaken in
            the bronze-floored house of Zeus, the scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth.
            [175] With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial
            locks that flowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put on the
            wondrous robe which Athena had worked for her with consummate art, and had set on it
            many embellishments; [180] she fastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she
            girded herself with a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings,
            three brilliant pendants with much charm radiating from them, through the pierced lobes
            of her ears, [185] and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on
            to her feet, and when she had finished making herself up in perfect order, she left her
            room and called Aphrodite to come aside and speak to her. [190] “My dear child, said
            she, will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse me because you are angry
            at my being on the Danaan side, while you are on the Trojan?” </p>
          <p>Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite answered, “Hera, august queen of goddesses, daughter of mighty
            Kronos, [195] say what you want, and I will do it for at once, if I can, and if it can
            be done at all.” Then Hera told her a lying tale and said, “I want you to endow me with
            some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all things mortal and
            immortal to your feet. [200] I am going to the world’s end to visit <seg
              rend="subscript">201</seg> Ōkeanos, the genesis [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >genesis</foreign>] of gods, and mother Tethys: they received me in their house, took
            care of me, and brought me up, having taken me over from Rhaea when Zeus imprisoned
            great Kronos in the depths that are under earth and sea. [205] I must go and see them
            that I may make peace between them; they have been quarreling, and are so angry that
            they have not slept with one another this long while; if I can bring them round and
            restore them to one another’s embraces, [210] they will be grateful to me and love me
            for ever afterwards.”</p>
          <p>Thereon laughter-loving Aphrodite said, “I cannot and must not refuse you, for you
            sleep in the arms of Zeus who is our king.” </p>
          <p>As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the finely woven girdle [215] into which all her
            charms had been wrought—love, desire, and that sweet flattery which steals the judgment
            even of the most prudent. She gave the girdle to Hera and said, “Take this girdle
            wherein all my charms reside [220] and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I
            promise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.” </p>
          <p>When she heard this Hera smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle in her bosom.
            Aphrodite now went back into the house of Zeus, [225] while Hera darted down from the
            summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and went on and on till she
            came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped
            without ever setting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the waves
            of the sea till she reached Lemnos, [230] the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep,
            own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying, “Sleep, you who lord it alike
            over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a service in times past, do one for me
            now, [235] and I shall show gratitude to you ever after. Close Zeus’ keen eyes for me in
            slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden
            seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Hephaistos [240] shall make it
            for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you
            are at table.” </p>
          <p>Then Sleep answered, “Hera, great queen of goddesses, daughter of mighty Kronos, I
            would lull any other of the gods to sleep without compunction, not even excepting the
            waters of Okeanos [245] from whom all of them proceed, but I dare not go near Zeus, nor
            send him to sleep unless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what
            you asked me, [250] on the day when Zeus’ mighty son Hēraklēs set sail from Ilion after
            having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused my sweet self over the
            mind of aegis-bearing Zeus, and laid him to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against
            Hēraklēs, and set the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him
            [255] to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Zeus was furious when he
            awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the house; he was looking more
            particularly for myself, and would have flung me down through space into the sea where I
            should never have been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods
            protected me. [260] I fled to her and Zeus left off looking for me in spite of his being
            so angry, for he did not dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are again
            asking me to do something on which I cannot venture.”</p>
          <p>And Hera said, “Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into your head? [265] Do
            you think Zeus will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as he was about his own son?
            Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest of the Graces, and she shall be your
            own—Pasithea, whom you have always wanted to marry.” </p>
          <p>[270] Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, “Then swear it to me by the
            dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous earth, and the other on
            the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who dwell down below with Kronos may be our
            witnesses, [275] and see that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharites</foreign>]—Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to
            marry.” </p>
          <p>Hera did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the nether world, who
            are called Titans, to witness. [280] When she had completed her oath, the two enshrouded
            themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbros behind
            them. Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum
            where they left the sea to go on by land, [285] and the tops of the trees of the forest
            soughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere Zeus caught sight of
            him he climbed a lofty pine-tree—the tallest that reared its head towards heaven on all
            Ida. He hid himself behind the branches and sat there [290] in the semblance of the
            sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Khalkis by the gods, but men
            call it Kymindis. Hera then went to Gargaros, the topmost peak of Ida, and Zeus, driver
            of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the same
            passionate desire for her that he had felt [295] when they had first enjoyed each
            other’s embraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents knowing anything
            about it. He went up to her and said, “What do you want that you have come hither from
            Olympus—and that too with neither chariot nor horses to convey you?” </p>
          <p>[300] Then Hera told him a lying tale and said, “I am going to the world’s end, to
              visit <seg rend="subscript">302</seg> Ōkeanos, the genesis [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >genesis</foreign>] of gods, and mother Tethys; they received me into their house,
            took care of me, and brought me up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between
            them: [305] they have been quarreling, and are so angry that they have not slept with
            one another this long time. The horses that will take me over land and sea are stationed
            on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on
            purpose to consult you. [310] I was afraid you might be angry with me later on, if I
            went to the house of Okeanos without letting you know.” </p>
          <p>And Zeus said, “Hera, you can choose some other time for paying your visit to
            Okeanos—for the present let us devote ourselves to love and to the enjoyment of one
            another. [315] Never yet have I been so overpowered by passion neither for goddess nor
            mortal woman as I am at this moment for yourself—not even when I was in love with the
            wife of Ixion who bore me Peirithoos, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae, the
            daintily-ankled daughter of Acrisius, [320] who bore me the famed hero Perseus. Then
            there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele,
            and Alkmene in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hēraklēs, [325] while Semele
            became mother to Bacchus, the comforter of humankind. There was queen Demeter again, and
            lovely Leto, and yourself—but with none of these was I ever so much enamored as I now am
            with you.” </p>
          <p>Hera again answered him with a lying tale. [330] “Most dread son of Kronos,” she
            exclaimed, “what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one another here on the
            top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen? What if one of the ever-living gods
            should see us sleeping together, and tell the others? [335] It would be such a scandal
            that when I had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside your house
            again; but if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Hephaistos has made me,
            and he has given it good strong doors; [340] if you would so have it, let us go thither
            and lie down.” </p>
          <p>And Zeus answered, “Hera, you need not be afraid that either god or man will see you,
            for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden cloud, that the very sun [345] for
            all his bright piercing beams shall not see through it.” </p>
          <p>With this the son of Kronos caught his wife in his embrace; whereon the earth sprouted
            them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft
            and thick that it raised them well above the ground. [350] Here they laid themselves
            down and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell
            glittering dew-drops. Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the
            crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse in his arms.
            Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, [355] to tell earth-encircling
            Poseidon, lord of the earthquake. When he had found him he said, “Now, Poseidon, you can
            help the Danaans with a will, and give them victory though it be only for a short time
            while Zeus is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, [360] and Hera has
            beguiled him into going to bed with her.” </p>
          <p>Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among humankind, leaving Poseidon more
            eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward among the first ranks and shouted
            saying, “Argives, shall we let Hector, [365] son of Priam, have the triumph of taking
            our ships and covering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall now do,
            seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well without
            him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another. [370] Now, therefore, let
            us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put
            on our helmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you
            on, [375] and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us.
            If any good staunch warrior has only a small shield, let him hand it over to a worse
            man, and take a larger one for himself.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. [380] The son of Tydeus, Odysseus,
            and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in array, and went about
            everywhere effecting the exchanges of armor; the most valiant took the best armor, and
            gave the worse to the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armor they marched on
            with Poseidon at their head. [385] In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword,
            keen of edge and flashing like lightning; it is not the right thing to do, to come
            across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it. </p>
          <p>Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Poseidon and Hector waged
            fierce war [390] on one another—Hector on the Trojan and Poseidon on the Argive side.
            Mighty was the uproar as the two forces met; the sea came rolling in towards the ships
            and tents of the Achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly [395] when
            driven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more fiercely
            when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music as
            it tears on through the tops of oaks when it is blowing its hardest, [400] than the
            terrible shout which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one
            another. </p>
          <p>Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards him, nor did he miss
            his aim. The spear struck him where two bands passed over his chest— [405] the band of
            his shield and that of his silver-studded sword—and these protected his body. Hector was
            angry that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his
            men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone, [410] of
            which there were many lying about under the men’s feet as they fought—brought there to
            give support to the ships’ sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them
            and struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin
            round like a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when uprooted by
            the lightning flash of father Zeus, [415] and there is a terrible smell of brimstone—no
            man can help being dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful
            thing—even so did Hector fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand,
            but his shield and helmet were made fast about his body, [420] and his bronze armor rang
            about him. </p>
          <p>The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him, hoping to drag him
            away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans, but none of them could wound him
            before he was surrounded [425] and covered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor,
            Sarpedon, leader of the Lycians, and noble Glaukos: of the others, too, there was not
            one who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to cover him.
            His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle to the
            place [430] where his horses stood waiting for him at the rear of the fight with their
            driver and the chariot; these then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain.
            When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthos, begotten of Immortal Zeus,
            [435] they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the ground; they poured
            water over him, and as they did so he breathed again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling
            on his knees he vomited blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were
            again closed in darkness for he was still stunned by the blow. </p>
          <p>[440] When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and set upon the
            Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax, fleet son of Oïleus, began by springing on Satnios,
            son of Enops, and wounding him with his spear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops
            [445] as he was herding cattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oïleus
            came up to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between
            Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas son of Panthoos drew near to avenge
            him, [450] and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilykos on the right shoulder; the terrible
            spear went right through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.
            Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, “Again I take it that the spear has not sped
            in vain from the strong hand of the son of Panthoos; [455] an Argive has caught it in
            his body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into the house of
            Hādēs.” </p>
          <p>The Argives were stung by grief on account of this boasting. Ajax, son of Telamon, was
            more angry than any, [460] for the man had fallen close by him; so he aimed at Polydamas
            as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by swerving aside and the spear struck
            Arkhelokhos son of Antenor, for heaven counseled his destruction; [465] it struck him
            where the head springs from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the
            tendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long
            before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, [470]
            “Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing as
            Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the
            horseman Antenor, for he is very like him.” </p>
          <p>[475] But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly vexed with grief.
            Akamas then bestrode his brother’s body and wounded Promakhos the Boeotian with his
            spear, for he was trying to drag his brother’s body away. Akamas vaunted loudly over him
            saying, “Argive archers, braggarts that you are, [480] toil and suffering shall not be
            for us only, but some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promakhos
            now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother’s blood has not long delayed;
            a man, therefore, may well be thankful [485] if he leaves a kinsman in his house behind
            him to avenge his fall.” </p>
          <p>His taunts gave grief to the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than any of them.
            He sprang towards Akamas, but Akamas did not stand his ground, and he killed Ilioneus,
            [490] son of the rich flock-master Phorbas, whom Hermes had favored and endowed with
            greater wealth than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos
            now wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from its socket: the
            spear went right through the eye [495] into the nape of the neck, and he fell,
            stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then drew his sword and smote him on the
            neck, so that both head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still
            sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, [500]
            and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. “Trojans,” he cried, “bid
            the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife
            also of Promakhos, son of Alegenor, will never be gladdened by the coming of her dear
            husband— [505] when we Argives return with our ships from Troy.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to see whither he
            might flee for safety. </p>
          <p>Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the Argives to bear
            away blood-stained spoils [510] after Poseidon lord of the earthquake had turned the
            fortune of war. Ajax, son of Telamon, was first to wound Hyrtios, son of Gyrtios, leader
            of the staunch Mysians. Antilokhos killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew
            Morys and Hippotion, [515] Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of Atreus
            then wounded Hyperenor, shepherd of his people, in the flank, and the bronze point made
            his entrails gush out as it tore in among them; on this his life-breath came hurrying
            out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness.
            [520] Ajax son of Oïleus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he
            to pursue fleeing foes when Zeus had spread panic among them.</p>
        </div>
        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 15</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] But when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set
            stakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans made a halt on
            reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. Zeus now woke on the crests of Ida,
            [5] where he was lying with golden-throned Hera by his side, and starting to his feet he
            saw the Trojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them
            pell-mell before them with King Poseidon in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the
            ground with his comrades gathered round him, [10] gasping for breath, wandering in mind
            and vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him. </p>
          <p>The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Hera. “I see, Hera,”
            said he, “you mischief- making trickster, that your cunning [15] has stayed Hector from
            fighting and has caused the rout of his army. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in
            which case you will be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not
            remember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your feet,
            and bound your hands in a chain of gold [20] which none might break, and you hung in
            mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were in a fury, but they could not
            reach you to set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and hurled him
            from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did not
            relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety [25] which I felt about noble Hēraklēs whom
            you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning the
            tempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mighty labors I brought him
            back again [30] to horse-pasturing Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn
            to leave off being so deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by the
            embraces out of which you have come here to trick me.” </p>
          <p>Ox-vision Hera trembled as he spoke, [35] and said, “May the heavens above and earth
            below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this is the most solemn
            oath that a blessed god can take—I tell you, I swear also by your own almighty head and
            by our bridal bed [40] —things over which I could never possibly perjure myself—that
            Poseidon is not punishing Hector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any
            doing of mine; it is all of his own mere notion because he was sorry to see the Achaeans
            hard pressed at their ships: [45] if I were advising him, I should tell him to do as you
            tell him.”</p>
          <p>The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, “If you, ox-vision Hera, [50] were always
            to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Poseidon, like it or no, would soon
            come round to your and my way of thinking. If, then, you are speaking the truth and mean
            what you say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell [55] Iris and Apollo,
            lord of the bow, that I want them—Iris, that she may go to the bronze-armored Achaean
            army and tell Poseidon to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may send
            Hector again into battle [60] and give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his
            present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they fall among the
            ships of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will then send his comrade Patroklos into
            battle, [65] and glorious Hector will kill him in front of Ilion after he has slain many
            warriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to avenge
            Patroklos, and from that time I will bring it about that the Achaeans shall persistently
            drive the Trojans back [70] till they fulfill the counsels of Athena and take Ilion. But
            I will not stay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have
            accomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, [75] according to the promise I made by
            bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and besought me to give Achilles,
            ransacker of cities, honor.” </p>
          <p>Hera of the white arms heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great
            Olympus. [80] Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast continents,
            and he says to himself, “Now I will be here, or there,” and he would have all manner of
            things—even so swiftly did Hera wing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in
            among the gods [85] who were gathered in the house of Zeus. When they saw her they all
            of them came up to her, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let the
            others be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis who was first to come running
            up to her. “Hera,” said she, [90] “why are you here? And you seem troubled—has your
            husband the son of Kronos been frightening you?” </p>
          <p>And Hera of the white arms answered, “Divine Themis, do not ask me about it. You know
            what a proud and cruel disposition my husband has. [95] Lead the gods to table, where
            you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which he has avowed. Many a one,
            mortal and immortal, will be angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting
            now.” </p>
          <p>[100] Then Hera sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house of Zeus.
            Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care, and she spoke up in a
            rage. “Fools that we are,” she cried, “to be thus madly angry with Zeus; [105] we keep
            on wanting to go up to him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and
            cares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals.
            Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; [110]
            Arēs, I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son Askalaphos has fallen in
            battle—the man whom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns himself
            to be.” </p>
          <p>When he heard this Arēs smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of his hands, and
            said in anger, [115] “Do not blame me, you gods that dwell in the heavens, if I go to
            the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of my son, even though it end in my being
            struck by Zeus’ lightning and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, [120] while he put on his
            armor. Then, Zeus would have been roused to still more fierce and implacable anger
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] against the other immortals, had not
            Athena, alarmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat and hurried outside.
            [125] She tore the helmet from his head and the shield from his shoulders, and she took
            the bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; then she said to violent
            Arēs, “Mad one, you are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all sense
            of respect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] and understanding [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]; [130] have you not heard what Hera of the white arms
            has said on coming straight from the presence of Olympian Zeus? Do you wish to go
            through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus,
            after having caused infinite mischief to all us others? [135] Zeus would instantly leave
            the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would
            grip us up one after another, guilty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>] or not
            guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for the death of your son; better men than he
            [140] have either been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect
            every one’s whole family.” </p>
          <p>With these words she took Arēs back to his seat. Meanwhile Hera called Apollo outside,
            with Iris the messenger of the gods. [145] “Zeus,” she said to them, “desires you to go
            to him at once on Mount Ida; when you have seen him you are to do as he may then tell
            you.” </p>
          <p>Then Hera left them and resumed her seat inside, [150] while Iris and Apollo made all
            haste on their way. When they reached Ida with its many springs, mother of wild beasts,
            they found wide-seeing Zeus seated on topmost Gargaros with a fragrant cloud encircling
            his head as with a diadem. They stood before his presence, [155] and he was pleased with
            them for having been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had given them. </p>
          <p>He spoke to Iris first. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, tell King Poseidon what I now tell
            you—and tell him true. [160] Tell him leave off fighting, and either join the company of
            the gods, or go down into the sea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider
            well whether he is strong enough to hold his own against me [165] if I attack him. I am
            older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level
            with myself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.” </p>
          <p>Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, [170] and as the cold hail or snowflakes that fly
            from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did she wing her way till she
            came close up to the great shaker of the earth. Then she said, “I have come, O
            dark-haired king that holds the world in his embrace, [175] to bring you a message from
            Zeus. He tells you leave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or go
            down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he will come
            down here and fight you. [180] He would have you keep out of his reach, for he is older
            and much stronger than you are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a
            level with himself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.”</p>
          <p>Poseidon was very angry and said, [185] “Great heavens—strong as Zeus may be, he has
            said more than he can do if he has threatened violence against me, who am of like honor
            with himself. We were three brothers whom Rhea bore to Kronos - Zeus, myself, and Hādēs
            who rules the world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of
            us was to have an equal share. [190] When we cast lots, it fell to me to have my
            dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hādēs took the darkness of the realms under the earth,
            while air and sky and clouds were the portion that fell to Zeus; but earth and great
            Olympus are the common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Zeus would have me.
            For all his strength, let him keep to his own third share [195] and be contented without
            threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody. Let him keep his bragging talk
            for his own sons and daughters, who must perforce obey him.”</p>
          <p>[200] Iris fleet as the wind then answered, “Am I really, Poseidon, to take this daring
            and unyielding message to Zeus, or will you reconsider your answer? Sensible people are
            open to argument, and you know that the Furies [Erinyes] always range themselves on the
            side of the older person.”</p>
          <p>[205] Poseidon, the shaker of the earth, answered, “Goddess Iris, your words have been
            spoken in season. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless it
            cuts me to the very heart with grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] that any
            one should rebuke so angrily another [210] who is his own peer, and of like empire with
            himself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let me
            tell you, and I mean what I say—if contrary to the desire of myself, Athena driver of
            the spoil, Hera, Hermes, and King Hephaistos, [215] Zeus spares steep Ilion, and will
            not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of ransacking it, let him understand that he
            will incur our implacable resentment.”</p>
          <p>Poseidon now left the field to go down under the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>], and sorely did the Achaeans miss him. [220] Then Zeus said to
            Apollo, “Go, dear Phoebus, to brazen-helmeted Hector, for Poseidon who holds the earth
            in his embrace has now gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure.
            Had he not done so those gods [225] who are below with Kronos would have come to hear of
            the fight between us. It is better for both of us that he should have curbed his anger
            and kept out of my reach, for I should have had much trouble with him. Take, then, your
            tasseled aegis, [230] and shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a
            panic; take, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to
            deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent fleeing back to their ships and to
              the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Hellespont</foreign>. From that point I will think it
            well over, [235] how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponoi</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying like a falcon,
            bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found radiant Hector no longer lying upon
            the ground, but sitting up, [240] for he had just come to himself again. He knew those
            who were about him, and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when
            the thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of aegis-bearing Zeus had revived
            him. Apollo stood beside him and said, “Hector, son of Priam, why are you so faint,
            [245] and why are you here away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?” </p>
          <p>Hector in a weak voice answered, “And which, kind sir, of the gods are you, who now ask
            me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on the chest with a stone [250] as I was
            killing his comrades at the ships of the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off
            fighting? I made sure that this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the
            house of Hādēs.” </p>
          <p>Then King Apollo said to him, “Take heart; the son of Kronos has sent you a mighty
            helper [255] from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even me, Phoebus Apollo of the
            golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto not only of yourself but of your city.
            Now, therefore, order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great
            multitudes. [260] I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn
            the Achaeans in flight.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people. And as a horse,
            stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously over the plain [265] to the
            place where he is wont to take his bath in the river—he tosses his head, and his mane
            streams over his shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to
            the pastures where the mares are feeding—even so Hector, when he heard what the god
            said, urged his horsemen on, [270] and sped forward as fast as his limbs could take him.
            As country peasants set their hounds on to a horned stag or wild goat—he has taken
            shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot find him, [275] but, lo, a bearded lion
            whom their shouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in no further humor for
            the chase—even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body, using their swords and
            spears pointed at both ends, but when they saw Hector going about among his men [280]
            they were afraid, and their hearts fell down into their feet. </p>
          <p>Then spoke Thoas son of Andraimon, leader of the Aetolians, a man who could throw a
            good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight, while few could surpass him in
            debate when opinions were divided. [285] He then with all sincerity and goodwill
            addressed them thus: “What, in the gods’ name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to
            life again? Every one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, [290] but it
            seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans
            already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand of Zeus must be with him or he would
            never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let
            us all do as I say; [295] let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the
            ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm, and see
            whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our spears as soon as he comes near
            us; I conceive that he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into the
            press of the Danaans.”</p>
          <p>[300] Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were about Ajax
            and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Arēs
            called all their best men about them and sustained the fight against Hector and the
            Trojans, [305] but the main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on at their head.
            Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud about his shoulders. He bore aloft the
            terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe, [310] which Hephaistos the smith had given Zeus
            to strike terror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the
            Trojans. </p>
          <p>The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle rose high from
            either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong
            hands [315] and fastened in the bodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to
            earth midway, before they could taste of man’s fair flesh and glut themselves with
            blood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the
            weapons on either side took effect and the people fell, [320] but when he shook it
            straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts
            fainted within them and they forgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring
            in the dead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep [325] when the
            herdsman is not there—even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo filled them
            with panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans. </p>
          <p>The fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where they best could.
            Hector killed Stikhios and Arkesilaos, [330] the one, leader of the bronze-armored
            Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of great-hearted Menestheus. Aeneas killed
            Medon and Iasos. The first was bastard son to godlike Oïleus, and brother to Ajax, but
            he lived in Phylake [335] away from his own country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman
            of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oïleus had married. Iasos had become a leader of the
            Athenians, and was son of Sphelos the son of Boukolos. Polydamas killed Mekisteus, and
            Polites Ekhios, [340] in the front of the battle, while radiant Agenor slew Klonios.
            Paris struck Deiokhos from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as he was fleeing
            among the foremost, and the point of the spear went clean through him. </p>
          <p>While they were despoiling these heroes of their armor, the Achaeans were fleeing in
            confusion to the trench and the set stakes, [345] and were forced back within their
            wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, “Forward to the ships, and let the spoils
            be. If I see any man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I will
            have him killed: [350] his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire,
            but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses’ shoulders and called to the Trojans
            throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a cry that rent the air, and kept their
            horses neck and neck with his own. [355] Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the
            banks of the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as
            the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured
            over the bridge, [360] and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down
            the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a
            house of sand and then kicks it down again and destroys it— [365] even so did you, O
            Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and
            confusion. </p>
          <p>Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to one another and
            raising their hands with loud cries every man to the heavens. [370] Nestor of Gerenia,
            tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up his hands to the starry firmament of the
            heavens, and prayed more fervently than any of them. “Father Zeus,” said he, “if ever
            any one in wheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed
            that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to him in assent, [375]
            bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus over the Achaeans.” </p>
          <p>All counseling Zeus thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of the aged son of Neleus.
            When they heard Zeus thunder [380] they flung themselves yet more fiercely on the
            Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a
            gale—for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great—even so did the
            Trojans spring over the wall with a shout, [385] and drive their chariots onwards. The
            two sides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter—the Trojans
            from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the long
            pikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with
            bronze.</p>
          <p>[390] Now Patroklos, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about the wall,
            but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting in the tent of good
            Eurypylos, entertaining him with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to
            ease his pain. [395] When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in
            the wall, while the Achaeans were clamoring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and
            smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. “Eurypylos,” said he in his dismay, “I
            know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, [400] for there is hard
            fighting going on; an attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] shall take
            care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to fight if I
            can; who knows but with the help of a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a
            friend.”</p>
          <p>[405] When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and resisted the
            attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in number, they could not drive them
            back from the ships, neither could the Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their
            way in among the tents and ships. [410] As a carpenter’s line gives a true edge to a
            piece of ship’s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Athena has instructed
            in all kinds of useful arts—even so level was the issue of the fight between the two
            sides, as they fought some round one and some round another. </p>
          <p>[415] Hector made straight for glorious Ajax, and they put up fierce struggle [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] over the same ship. Hector could not force Ajax back
            and fire the ship, nor yet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which a superhuman
            force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] had brought him. </p>
          <p>Then shining Ajax struck Kaletor [420] son of Klytios in the chest with a spear as he
            was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground and the torch dropped
            from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen in front of the ship he shouted to the
            Trojans and Lycians saying, [425] “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight,
            bate not a jot, but rescue the son of Klytios lest the Achaeans strip him of his armor
            now that he has fallen in the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>He then aimed a spear at Ajax, [430] and missed him, but he hit Lykophron an attendant
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was
            living with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector’s spear
            struck him on the head below the ear, [435] and he fell headlong from the ship’s prow on
            to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his brother,
            “Teucer, my good man, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live
            with us from Cythera and whom we honored as much as our own beloved parents. [440]
            Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus
            Apollo gave you.” </p>
          <p>Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in his hands. Right
            then and there he showered his arrows on the Trojans, [445] and hit Kleitos, the
            glorious son of Peisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of Panthoös, with the reins
            in his hands as he was attending to his horses; he was in the middle of the very
            thickest part of the fight, doing good service to Hector and the Trojans, [450] but evil
            had now come upon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert it, for
            the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses
            shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King Polydamas saw what had happened, and was
            the first to come up to the horses; [455] he gave them in charge to Astynoos, son of
            Protiaon, and ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went
            back and took his place in the front ranks. </p>
          <p>Teucer then aimed another arrow at bronze-helmeted Hector, and there would have been no
            more fighting at the ships [460] if he had hit him and killed him then and there: but
            Teucer did not escape the notice [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Zeus, who
            kept watch over Hector and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for
            him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this the arrow went astray
            [465] and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother,
            “Alas, see how a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] thwarts us
            in all we do; he has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I
            strung it this selfsame morning [470] that it might serve me for many an arrow.” </p>
          <p>Ajax, son of Telamon, answered, “My good man, let your bow and your arrows be, for Zeus
            has made them useless in order to spite the Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield
            upon your shoulder, [475] and both fight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so.
            They may be successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a
            hard matter to take the ships.” </p>
          <p>Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield four hides thick
            about his shoulders, [480] and on his comely head he set his helmet well wrought with a
            crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable
            bronze-shod spear, and right then and there he was by the side of Ajax. </p>
          <p>When Hector saw that Teucer’s bow was of no more use to him, [485] he shouted out to
            the Trojans and Lycians, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, be men,
            my friends, and show your mettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their
            chieftains made useless by the hand of Zeus. [490] It is easy to see when Zeus is
            helping people and means to help them still further, or again when he is bringing them
            down and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is going against the
            Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. [495] If any of you is struck by
            spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honor who dies fighting for
            his country; and he will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his house and
            allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to their own land, they
            and their ships.”</p>
          <p>[500] With these words he put life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] and
            spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] into them all. Ajax on the other side
            exhorted his comrades saying, “Shame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] on you
            Argives, we are now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy
            from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, [505] that you will be able to get
            home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his whole army to fire our fleet, and
            telling them to remember that they are not at a dance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >khoros</foreign>] but in battle? Our only thought [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>] and plan [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>] [510] is to fight
            them with might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once for all, than
            fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.” </p>
          <p>With these words he put life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] and spirit
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] into them all. [515] Hector then killed
            Skhedios son of Perimedes, leader of the Phocians, and Ajax killed Laodamas leader of
            foot soldiers and shining son to Antenor. Polydamas killed Otos of Cyllene a comrade of
            the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud Epeioi. [520] When Meges saw this he sprang
            upon him, but Polydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer
            the son of Panthoös to fall in battle; but the spear hit Kroismos in the middle of his
            chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of his armor. [525]
            At that moment the valiant warrior Dolops, son of Lampos, sprang upon him; Lampos was
            son of Laomedon and noted for his valor, while his son Dolops was versed in all the ways
            of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus’ [= Meges’] shield with his
            spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his good corselet [530] made with plates of
            metal saved him; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his
            host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It now served
            to save the life of his son. [535] Then Meges struck the topmost crest of Dolops’ bronze
            helmet with his spear and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with
            scarlet as it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and
            confident of victory, [540] warlike Menelaos came up to help Meges, and got by the side
            of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from behind, and the point,
            driven so furiously, went through into his chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then
            made towards him to strip him of his armor, [545] but Hector called on all his brothers
            for help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippos, son of Hiketaon, who once upon a
            time used to pasture his herds of cattle in Perkote before the war broke out; [550] but
            when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >Ilion</foreign>, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam who
            treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said, “Why, Melanippos,
            are we thus remiss? Do you take no note of the death of your kinsman, [555] and do you
            not see how they are trying to take Dolops’ armor? Follow me; there must be no fighting
            the Argives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill
            them or they take the high wall of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Ilion</foreign> and slay her
            people.” </p>
          <p>He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippos followed after. [560] Meanwhile huge
            Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. “My friends,” he cried, “be men, and
            fear the loss of respect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>]; quit yourselves in
            battle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect each other’s good opinion
            are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but in flight there is neither gain
            nor glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>[565] Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the Trojans. They
            laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with a wall of bronze, while Zeus urged
            on the Trojans. Menelaos of the loud battle-cry urged Antilokhos on. “Antilokhos,” said
            he, “you are young [570] and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more
            valiant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill him.” </p>
          <p>He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilokhos, who at once darted out from the
            front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully round him. [575] The Trojans fell
            back as he threw, and the dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck
            Melanippos the proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming
            forward, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
            Antilokhos sprang upon him [580] as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it
            was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippos, did stalwart
            Antilokhos spring upon you to strip you of your armor; but noble Hector marked him, and
            came running up to him through the thick of the battle. [585] Antilokhos, brave warrior
            though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature which
            knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a dog or a man who is herding his
            cattle, before a body of men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor
            flee, and the Trojans and radiant Hector [590] with a cry that rent the air showered
            their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached
            his comrades. </p>
          <p>The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships in fulfillment of
            the behests of Zeus who kept spurring them on to new deeds of daring, [595] while he
            deadened the courage of the Argives and defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he
            meant giving glory to Hector, son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships,
            till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Zeus, therefore,
            bided his time [600] till he should see the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour he
            was about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from the ships and to grant
            glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector, son of Priam, who was eager
            enough already, to assail the ships. [605] His fury was as that of spear-shaking Arēs,
            or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains; he
            foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet
            quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with which he fought. [610] Zeus from the
            heavens was with him, and though he was but one against many, granted him victory and
            glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas Athena was hurrying on
            the hour of his destruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. [615] Now, however, he
            kept trying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in
            the goodliest armor; but do what he might he could not break through them, for they
            stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from the gray sea that braves
            the anger of the gale, [620] and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon
            them like flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by
            wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, [625] the fierce winds
            roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and they are saved
            but by a very little from destruction—even so were the hearts of the Achaeans fainting
            within them. [630] Or as a savage lion attacking a herd of cows while they are feeding
            by thousands in the low-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore—the herdsman is at his
            wit’s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the van and now in the
            rear of his cattle, [635] while the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a
            cow so that they all tremble for fear—even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken
            by Hector and father Zeus. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he was
            son of Kopreus [640] who was wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty
            Hēraklēs, but the son was far better in excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aretē</foreign>] than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant
            warrior, and in understanding [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] ranked among the
            foremost men of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Mycenae</foreign>. He it was who then afforded
            Hector a triumph, [645] for as he was turning back he stumbled against the rim of his
            shield which reached his feet, and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped
            against this and fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did
            so. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; [650] he then thrust a spear into his chest,
            and killed him close to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not help
            him for they were themselves terribly afraid of Hector. </p>
          <p>They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been drawn up first were
            on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring after them. [655] The Argives were
            driven back from the first row of ships, but they made a stand by their tents without
            being broken up and scattered; shame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] and fear
            restrained them. They kept shouting incessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerenia,
            tower of strength to the Achaeans, [660] was loudest in imploring every man by his
            parents, and beseeching him to stand firm. </p>
          <p>“Be men, my friends,” he cried, “and give respect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aidōs</foreign>] to one another’s good opinion. Think, all of you, on your children,
            your wives, your property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. [665] On
            their behalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in
            flight.” </p>
          <p>With these words he put heart and spirit into them all. Athena lifted the thick veil of
            darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon them, [670] alike on the side of the
            ships and on that where the fight was raging. They could see Hector of the great war cry
            and all his men, both those in the rear who were taking no part in the battle, and those
            who were fighting by the ships. </p>
          <p>Great-hearted Ajax could not bring himself to retreat [675] along with the rest, but
            strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits long and
            jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of charioteering [680] couples four horses
            together and comes tearing full speed along the public way from the country into some
            large town—many both men and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time
            changing his horse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet while
            the horses are at a gallop— [685] even so did Ajax go striding from one ship’s deck to
            another, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the
            Danaans and exhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain
            within the main body of the Trojan warriors, [690] but as a dun eagle swoops down upon a
            flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river—geese, it may be, or cranes, or long-necked
            swans—even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it;
            [695] for Zeus with his mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to
            follow him. </p>
          <p>And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have thought the men
            were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] in which they were— [700] the Achaeans did
            not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves doomed, while there
            was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with the hope of firing the ships and putting
            the Achaean heroes to the sword. </p>
          <p>Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the good ship [705]
            that had brought Protesilaos to Troy, but never bore him back to his native land. Round
            this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did
            not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, [710] but with one mind hacked at one
            another in close combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends; they
            fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted
            and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, [715] and the earth
            ran red with blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but
            held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, “Bring fire, and raise the
            battle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Zeus granted us a day that will pay
            us for all the rest; [720] this day we shall take the ships which came here against the
            gods’ will, and which have caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of
            our councilors, who when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade
            the army to follow me; if Zeus did then indeed warp our judgments, [725] himself now
            commands me and cheers me on.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans, and Ajax no
            longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts that were flung at him, and
            made sure that he was doomed. Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and
            stepped back on to the seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. [730] Here he stood on the
            look-out, and with his spear held back the Trojans whom he saw bringing fire to the
            ships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting the
            Danaans. “My friends,” he cried, “Danaan heroes, attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs, be men my friends, and fight with might and with
            main. [735] Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely
            than the one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may draw fresh
            population [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] to turn the scales in our favor.
            We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>] behind us, [740] and far from our own country. Our salvation,
            therefore, is in the might of our hands and in hard fighting.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when any Trojan made
            towards the ships with fire to win favor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>]
            with Hector, [745] he would be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long
            spear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships. </p>

          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaos. Then Patroklos
            drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some spring whose
            crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. [5] When swift-footed radiant
            Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said, “Why, Patroklos, do you
            stand there weeping like some unaware [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nēpiē</foreign>] little

            hold of her mother’s dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, [10] and looks
            tearfully up until her mother carries her—even such tears, Patroklos, are you now
            shedding. Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself, or have you had news
            from Phthia which you alone know? They tell me Menoitios, son of Aktor, is still alive,
            [15] as also Peleus son of Aiakos, among the Myrmidons—men whose loss we two should
            bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in which they are
            being killed at the ships, through their own high-handed doings? Do not hide in your
            mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] anything from me but tell me that both of
            us may know about it.”</p>
          <p>[20] Then, O charioteer Patroklos, with a deep sigh you answered, “Achilles, son of
            Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, <seg rend="subscript">22</seg> do not be
            angry, for such a grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] has beset [=
              brought <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign> upon] the Achaeans. All those who have
            been their champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear. [25]
            Brave Diomedes son of Tydeus has been hit with a spear, while famed Odysseus and
            Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylos again has been struck with an arrow in
            the thigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them of their
            wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? [30] May it never be my lot to nurse
            such a passion as you have done, to the damage of your own good name. Who in future
            story will speak well of you <seg rend="subscript">32</seg> if you do not ward off the
            disgraceful devastation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">loigos</foreign>] from the
            Argives?  You know no pity; charioteer Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your
            mother, but the gray sea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, [35] so cruel and
            remorseless are you in your thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. If
            however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle, or if your mother Thetis has
            told you something from the mouth of Zeus, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me,
            if I may bring deliverance to the Danaans. [40] Let me moreover wear your armor; the
            Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of
            the Achaeans may have breathing time—which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who
            are fresh might soon drive tired men [45] back from our ships and tents to their own
            city.” </p>
          <p>He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own destruction. Achilles
            was deeply moved and answered, “What, noble Patroklos, are you saying? [50] I know no
            prophesyings which I am heeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of
              Zeus, <seg rend="subscript">52</seg> but I have this terrible sorrow [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] that has come over my heart and spirit [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">53</seg> seeing as I do that
            the man [= Agamemnon] is trying to deprive a man who is equal to [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">homoios</foreign>] him <seg rend="subscript">54</seg> and to take away
            the prize of this man [= Achilles], just because he [= Agamemnon] is ahead in
            power. [55] the terrible <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>that I have, since I
            suffered pains [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">algea</foreign>] in my <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign> is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans
            chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on having ransacked a city—her has
            King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were some common vagrant. [60] Still, let
            bygones be bygones: no man may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till
            battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armor
            about your shoulders, [65] and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark cloud of
            Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the Argives are driven back on to the beach,
            cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out
            against them, [70] because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them. Had
            they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled with
            their dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon
            had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset our army. [75] Diomedes son of
            Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither have I heard the voice
            of the son of Atreus coming from his hated [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ekhthrē</foreign>]
            head, whereas that of manslaughtering Hector rings in my ears as he gives orders to the
            Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry of
            battle. [80] Even so, Patroklos, ward off the devastation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >loigos</foreign>] from the ships <seg rend="subscript">81</seg> and attack with power
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kratos</foreign>], lest they [the Trojans] burn <seg
              rend="subscript">82</seg> the ships with blazing fire and take away a safe homecoming
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>]. Bring to fulfillment [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] what I now order you to do, so that you may win me
            great honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] [85] from all the Danaans, and
            that they may restore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When
            you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Hera’s thundering
            husband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight the Trojans further in my
            absence, [90] or you will rob me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of
            battle go on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilion, lest one of the
            ever-living gods from Olympus attack you—for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: [95] return
            when you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon the plain. <seg
              rend="subscript">97</seg> Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo! If only <seg
              rend="subscript">98</seg> not one of all the Trojans could escape destruction, <seg
              rend="subscript">99</seg> nor a single one of the Argives, while you and I emerge from
            the slaughter, [100] so that we two alone may break Troy’s sacred coronal.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for the shower of
            darts that rained upon him; the will [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Zeus
            and the javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed about his
            temples rang [105] with the continuous clatter of the missiles that kept pouring on to
            it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected his face. Moreover his left shoulder was
            tired with having held his shield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they
            would, they could not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat
            rained from every pore of his body, [110] he had not a moment’s respite, and on all
            sides he was beset by danger upon danger. </p>
          <p>And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how fire was thrown upon
            the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up and let drive with his great sword at
            the ashen spear of Ajax. [115] He cut it clean in two just behind where the point was
            fastened on to the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless
            spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground.
            Ajax knew the hand of the gods in this, [120] and was dismayed at seeing that Zeus had
            now left him utterly defenseless and was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he
            drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in
            flame. </p>
          <p>The fire was now flaring about the ship’s stern, whereon Achilles smote his two thighs
            [125] and said to Patroklos, “Up, noble charioteer, for I see the glare of hostile fire
            at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships, and there be no way by which we may
            retreat. Gird on your armor at once while I call our people together.” </p>
          <p>[130] As he spoke Patroklos put on his armor. First he greaved his legs with greaves of
            good make, and fitted with ankle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of
            the swift-footed descendant of Aiakos, richly inlaid and studded. [135] He hung his
            silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his
            comely head he set his helmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded
            menacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands, [140] but
            he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of the
            Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so easily—  <seg rend="subscript"
              >143</seg> the Pelian ash-spear, which Cheiron had given to his <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign> father, <seg rend="subscript">144</seg> from the
            heights of Mount Pelion, to be death for heroes. He bade [145] Automedon yoke his horses
            with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honor next after Achilles, and on
            whose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet
            horses Xanthos and Balios, [150] steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they
            whom the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the
            waters of the river Okeanos. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasos, whom
            Achilles breaker of battles had brought away with him when he ransacked the city of
            Eëtion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his place along with those that
            were immortal. </p>
          <p>[155] Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade his Myrmidons
            put on their armor. Even as fierce ravening wolves that are feasting upon a horned stag
            which they have killed upon the mountains, and their jaws are red with blood— [160] they
            go in a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they
            reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives
            them—even so did the leaders and counselors of the Myrmidons [165] gather round the good
            attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of the fleet descendant of
            Aiakos, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses. </p>
          <p>Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, [170] and in each there was a crew of
            fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five leaders whom he could trust, while he was himself
            commander over them all. Menesthios of the gleaming corselet, son to the river
            Sperkheios that streams from the heavens, was leader of the first company. [175] Fair
            Polydora daughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Sperkheios—a woman mated with a god
            – but he was called son of Boros, son of Perieres, with whom his mother was living as
            his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. The second company was led by
            noble Eudoros, [180] son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas, graceful in
            dancing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>], bore him; the mighty slayer of
            Argos was enamored of her as he saw her among the singing women at a dance [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>] held in honor of Artemis the rushing huntress of the
            golden arrows; he therefore—Hermes, giver of all good—went with her into an upper
            chamber, [185] and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudoros,
            singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Eileithuia goddess of the pains of
            child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty
            Ekhekles son of Aktor took the mother to wife, [190] and gave great wealth to gain her,
            but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondly upon
            him as though he were his own son. The third company was led by warlike Peisandros son
            of Maimalos, the finest spearman among all the Myrmidons [195] next to Achilles’ own
            comrade Patroklos. The old charioteer Phoenix was leader of the fourth company, and
            Alkimedon, noble son of Laerkeus, of the fifth. </p>
          <p>When Achilles had chosen [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] his men and had
            stationed them all with their leaders, he charged them strictly saying, [200]
            “Myrmidons, remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the
            time of my anger, and you were all complaining of me. ‘Cruel son of Peleus,’ you would
            say, ‘your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here
            at the ships against our will; [205] if you are so relentless it were better we went
            home over the sea.’ Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now
            come for those high feats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep
            high hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.”</p>
          <p>[210] With these words he put heart and spirit into them all, and they serried their
            companies yet more closely when they heard the words of their king. As the stones which
            a builder sets in the wall of some high house which is to give shelter from the
            winds—even so closely were the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. [215]
            Shield pressed on shield, helmet on helmet, and man on man; so close were they that the
            horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they
            bent their heads. </p>
          <p>In front of them all two men put on their armor—Patroklos and Automedon—two men, with
            but one mind [220] to lead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles went inside his tent and opened
            the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board
            ship, and which she had filled with khitons, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick
            rugs. [225] In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but
            himself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other god save only to
            father Zeus. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulfur; this done he
            rinsed it with clean water, [230] and after he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then
            he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards the heavens, and making
            his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Zeus whose joy is in thunder. <seg
              rend="subscript">233</seg> “King Zeus,” he [= Achilles] cried out, “lord of Dodona,
            god of the Pelasgoi, who dwells afar, <seg rend="subscript">234</seg> you who hold
            stormy Dodona in your sway, where the Selloi, [235] your seers, dwell around you with
            their feet unwashed and their beds made upon the ground— <seg rend="subscript"
            >236</seg> just as you heard what I was saying when I prayed to you before, <seg
              rend="subscript">237</seg> and did me honor by sending disaster on the Achaean
              people, <seg rend="subscript">238</seg> so also now grant me the fulfillment of yet a

            assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of ships, [240] but I shall send my

              Myrmidons, <seg rend="subscript">241</seg> sending him to fight. Send forth, O
            all-seeing Zeus, a radiance [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kudos</foreign>] to go before
              him; <seg rend="subscript">242</seg> make bold the heart inside his chest so that
              Hector <seg rend="subscript">243</seg>may find out whether he [Patroklos] knows how to
            fight alone, <seg rend="subscript">244</seg> [Patroklos,] my attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>], or whether his hands can only then be so
            invincible [245] with their fury when I myself enter the war struggle of Arēs. <seg
              rend="subscript">246</seg> Afterwards when he [= Patroklos] has chased away from the
            ships the attack and the cry of battle, <seg rend="subscript">247</seg> grant that he
            may return unharmed to the swift ships, <seg rend="subscript">248</seg>with his armor
            and his comrades [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>], fighters in close
            combat.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">249</seg> Thus did he [Achilles] pray, and Zeus, the Planner,
            heard his prayer. [250] Part of it he did indeed grant him—but the other part he
              refused. <seg rend="subscript">251</seg> He granted that Patroklos should thrust back
            war and battle from the ships, <seg rend="subscript">252</seg> yes, he granted that. But
            he refused to let him come safely [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ex-apo-ne-e-sthai</foreign>]
            out of the fight.</p>
          <p>When he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles went inside his tent
            and put back the cup into his chest.</p>
          <p>[255] Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce fight that
            raged between the Trojans and Achaeans. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile the armed band that was about great-hearted Patroklos marched on till they
            sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like wasps [260] whose
            nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to tease, whereon anyone who
            happens to be passing may get stung—or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes
            them by accident, every wasp will come flying out [265] in a fury to defend his little
            ones—even with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their
            cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroklos called out to his men at the top of his voice,
            “Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, [270] be men my friends, fight with
            might and with main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the
            foremost man at the ships of the Argives—he, and his close fighting attendants [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>]. The son of Atreus wide-ruling King Agamemnon
            will thus recognize his derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] in showing
            no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[275] With these words he put heart and spirit into them all, and they fell in a body
            upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which the Achaeans raised, and when
            the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoitios and his attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign>] all gleaming in their armor, [280] they were daunted and their
            battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the fleet son of Peleus <seg
              rend="subscript">282</seg> had cast aside his state of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mēnis</foreign> and had chosen being <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >philos</foreign> instead. Every one, therefore, looked round about to see where he
            might flee for safety.</p>
          <p>Patroklos first aimed a spear into the middle of the press [285] where men were packed
            most closely, by the stern of the ship of great-hearted Protesilaos. He hit Pyraikhmes
            who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon and the broad waters of the river
            Axios; the spear struck him on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in
            the dust; [290] on this his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader,
            who was the finest warrior among them, Patroklos struck panic into them all. <seg
              rend="subscript">293</seg> He drove them [the Trojans] from the ships, and he quenched
            the blazing fire —leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. [295] The Trojans
            were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies, while the Danaans poured after
            them from their ships, shouting also without ceasing. As when Zeus, gatherer of the
            thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the
            peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest glades show out [300] in the great light that
            flashes from the bursting heavens, <seg rend="subscript">301</seg> thus the Danaans,
            having averted from the ships the burning fire, took breath for a little while; but the
            fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back in utter rout,
            [305] but still gave battle, and were ousted from their ground only by sheer
            fighting. </p>
          <p>The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one another when and
            how they could. The valiant son of Menoitios first drove his spear into the thigh of
            Areilykos just as he was turning round; [310] the point went clean through, and broke
            the bone so that he fell forward. Meanwhile warlike Menelaos struck Thoas in the chest,
            where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of Phyleus
            saw Amphiklos about to attack him, and before he could do so took aim at the upper part
            of his thigh, [315] where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the spear tore
            through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of
            Nestor one, Antilokhos, speared Atymnios, driving the point of the spear through his
            throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilokhos [320] in hand-to-hand fight to
            avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too
            quick for him, and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder before he could deal his
            blow; his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm,
            and tore them right down to the bone, [325] so he fell heavily to the ground and his
            eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to
            Erebos slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodoros, who
            had reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. [330] Ajax, son of Oïleus,
            sprang on Kleoboulos and took him alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed
            him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his blood, while
            dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.</p>
          <p>[335] Peneleos and Lykon now met in close fight, for they had missed each other with
            their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now they drew their swords. Lykon
            struck the plumed crest of Peneleos’ helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while
            Peneleos smote Lykon on the neck under the ear. [340] The blade sank so deep that the
            head was held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him.
            Meriones gave chase to Akamas on foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount
            his chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell headlong from
            the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness. [345] Idomeneus speared Erymas in the
            mouth; the bronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing
            in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were all of them knocked out
            and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from
            his mouth and nostrils, [350] and the darkness of death enfolded him round about. </p>
          <p>Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man. As ravening wolves
            seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when they are alone on the hillsides and have
            strayed from the main flock through the carelessness of the shepherd—and when the wolves
            see this [355] they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves—even
            so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their
            panic and had no more fight left in them. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into bronze-helmeted Hector, but
            Hector was so skillful [360] that he held his broad shoulders well under cover of his
            ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud
            of the spears. He well knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood
            his ground and tried to protect his comrades. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">364</seg> Just as when, down from Mount Olympus, a cloud
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nephos</foreign>] comes upon the sky [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ouranos</foreign>], [365] following an earlier moment of bright
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">diē</foreign>] air [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aithēr</foreign>], and when Zeus stretches [over the sky] a violent rainstorm
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">lailaps</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">366</seg> so also
            was there a clamorous routing of them [= the Trojans], driven away from the ships [of
            the Achaeans]. Hector’s fleet horses bore him and his armor out of the fight, and he
            left the Trojan army penned in by the deep trench against their will. [370] Many a yoke
            of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench and left their master’s car
            behind them. Patroklos gave chase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury
            against the Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways with their
            cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened [375] with the clouds of dust they raised,
            and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from the tents and ships towards the
            city.</p>
          <p>Patroklos kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men fleeing in confusion,
            cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed in all directions, and many a
            man came tumbling down from his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroklos,
            [380] whose immortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a
            bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set
            his heart on spearing him, but Hector’s horses were now hurrying him away. <seg
              rend="subscript">384</seg> Just as when, under the mass of a violent rainstorm, the
            dark earth in its entirety is weighed down [385] on that day in autumn when water is
            poured down most furiously  <seg rend="subscript">386 </seg>by Zeus, at a time when he
            feels anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kotos</foreign>] toward men and takes out his
            anger on them, <seg rend="subscript">387</seg> on the kinds of men who do violence [to
            justice] in the public assembly as they make crooked judgments about what is right and
            wrong [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themistes</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
            >388</seg> thus driving out justice [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>], since
            they do not care at all about the watchful eye of the gods, <seg rend="subscript"
              >389</seg> and their rivers are now all filled to overflowing, [390] and many of their
            terraced fields are being torn away by torrential rains <seg rend="subscript"
            >391</seg> and swept down toward the seething sea with a mighty groan,  <seg
              rend="subscript">392</seg> flowing straight down from the steep heights above, and now
            all the labor of farming is going to waste, <seg rend="subscript">393</seg> —so also did
            the horses of the Trojans let out a groan.</p>
          <p>Patroklos now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him [395] and drove them back
            to the ships. They were doing their best to reach the city, but he would not let them,
            and bore down on them between the river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade
            did he then avenge. First he hit Pronoos with a spear [400] on the chest where it was
            exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on
            Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had lost his
            head and the reins had been torn out of his hands. Patroklos went up to him and drove a
            spear into his right jaw; [405] he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him
            over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock and draws a
            strong fish out of the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] with a hook and a
            line—even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from his chariot; [410] he
            then threw him down on his face and he died while falling. Then, as Eurylaos was on to
            attack him, he struck him full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all
            battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of
            death took hold upon him. [415] Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,
            Amphoteros, Epaltes, Tlepolemos, Ekhios son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippos and
            Polymelos son of Argeas. </p>
          <p>Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, [420] men who wore unbelted tunics, being overcome
            by Patroklos son of Menoitios, he rebuked the godlike Lycians saying. “Shame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] on you, where are you fleeing to? Show your mettle; I
            will myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so masterful; he has done
            us much hurt, [425] and has stretched many a brave man upon the ground.” </p>
          <p>He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroklos, when he saw this, leaped on to
            the ground also. The two then rushed at one another with loud cries like eagle-beaked
            crooked-taloned vultures that scream and tear at one another [430] in some high mountain
            fastness. </p>
          <p>The son of scheming Kronos looked down upon them in pity and said to Hera who was his
            wife and sister, “Alas, that it should be the lot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to
            perish by the hand of Patroklos. [435] I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of
            the fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile district [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Lycia, or to let him now fall by the hand of the
            son of Menoitios.” </p>
          <p>And ox-vision Hera answered, [440] “Most dread son of Kronos, what is this that you are
            saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been fated, out of the jaws
            of death? Do as you will, but we shall not all of us be of your mind. I say further, and
            lay my saying to your heart, [445] that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home,
            some other of the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there
            are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you will make everyone
            jealous. [450] If, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall by the
            hand of Patroklos, but as soon as the life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]
            is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field [455] and take
            him to the expansive district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Lycia, <seg
              rend="subscript">456</seg> and there his relatives and comrades will ritually prepare
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tarkhuein</foreign>] him, <seg rend="subscript"
            >457</seg> with a tomb and a stele—for that is the privilege of the dead.”</p>
          <p>The sire of gods and men assented, but <seg rend="subscript">459</seg> he poured down
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kata-kheîn</foreign>] bloody drops [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psiades</foreign>] to the earth  [460] in honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>] of his son whom Patroklos was about to kill on the fertile plain of
            Troy far from his home. </p>
          <p>When they were now come close to one another Patroklos struck glorious Thrasydemos, the
            brave attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of Sarpedon, [465] in the
            lower part of the belly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroklos and
            missed him, but he struck the horse Pedasos in the right shoulder, and it screamed aloud
            as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went out of it. [470] The other two
            horses began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in the
            reins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but spear-famed
            Automedon knew what to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung
            by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; [475] whereon the other two righted
            themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into battle. </p>
          <p>Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroklos, and again missed him, the point of the
            spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting him. Patroklos then aimed in his
            turn, [480] and the spear sped not from his hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where
            the midriff surrounds the ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or
            tall pine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber for
            ship-building— [485] even so did he lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot
            and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with
            a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing in
            its clutches— [490] even so did the leader of the shield-armored Lycian warriors
            struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroklos. He called on his trusty comrade
            and said, “Glaukos, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth all your strength, fight
            with might and main, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant warrior. [495] First go
            about among the Lycian leaders and tell them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do
            battle to save my armor from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and for ever
            if the Achaeans rob me of my armor [500] now that I have fallen near the assembly
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of their ships. Do your very utmost and call
            all my people together.” </p>
          <p>The outcome [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] of death closed his eyes as he
            spoke. Patroklos planted his heel on his breast and drew the spear from his body,
            whereon his diaphragm came out along with it, [505] and he drew out both spear-point and
            Sarpedon’s life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] at the same time.
            Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding
            themselves deserted by their lords.</p>
          <p>Glaukos was overcome with grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] when he
            heard what Sarpedon said, for he could not help him. [510] He had to support his arm
            with his other hand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer’s arrow had
            given him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaukos, was assailing it. Therefore
            he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, “Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the
            fertile district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Lycia, [515] or may be in
            Troy, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress, as I now am.
            I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there is no staunching the blood,
            and my whole arm drags by reason of my hurt, [520] so that I cannot grasp my sword nor
            go among my foes and fight them, though our prince, Zeus’ son Sarpedon, is slain. Zeus
            defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease my pain and
            grant me strength both to cheer on [525] the Lycians and to fight along with them round
            the body of him who has fallen.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain, staunched the black
            blood from the wound, and gave him new strength. [530] Glaukos perceived this, and was
            thankful that the mighty god had answered his prayer; right then and there, he went
            among the Lycian leaders, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From
            these he strode on among the Trojans [535] to Polydamas son of Panthoös and radiant
            Agenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector of the brazen helmet, and when he
            had found them he said, “Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish
            here for your sake far from friends and home [540] while you do nothing to support them.
            Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has fallen—he who was at once the right and might
            of Lycia; brazen Arēs has laid him low by the spear of Patroklos. Stand by him, my
            friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armor, [545] nor to treat his
            body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have speared at the
            ships.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of
            the main stays of their city, [550] both as having many people with him, and himself the
            foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, they
            made instantly for the Danaans with all their might, while the undaunted spirit of
            Patroklos son of Menoitios cheered on the Achaeans. [555] First he spoke to the two
            Ajaxes, men who needed no words telling them what to do. “Ajaxes,” said he, “may it now
            please you to show yourselves the men you have always been, or even better—Sarpedon is
            fallen—he who was first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body and
            outrage it; [560] let us strip the armor from his shoulders, and kill his comrades if
            they try to rescue his body.” </p>
          <p>He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, therefore, the Trojans
            and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened
            their battalions, [565] and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting
            fiercely the while. Mighty was the din of their armor as they came together, and Zeus
            shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the ordeal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] of the battle over the body of his son. </p>
          <p>At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, [570] for one of the best
            men among the Myrmidons was killed, radiant Epeigeus, son of noble Agakles who had once
            upon a time been king in the good city of Boudeion; but presently, having killed a
            valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge with Peleus and silver-footed Thetis, [575]
            who sent him to Ilion the land of noble steeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles.
            Hector now struck him on the head with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body,
            and his brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face foremost
            upon the body of Sarpedon, [580] and there died. Patroklos was enraged with grief
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] over by the death of his comrade, and sped
            through the front ranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or
            starlings. Even so swiftly, [585] O noble charioteer Patroklos, did you make straight
            for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Right then and there he struck
            Sthenelaos the son of Ithaimenes on the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons that
            join it to the head and spine. Then glorious Hector and the front rank of his men gave
            ground. As far as a man can throw a javelin in competition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >āthlos</foreign>] for some prize, or even in battle— [590] so far did the Trojans now
            retreat before the Achaeans. Glaukos, leader of the shield-armored Lycians, was the
            first to rally them, [595] by killing Bathykles, son of Khalkon, who lived in Hellas and
            was supreme in wealth [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>] among the Myrmidons.
            Glaukos turned round suddenly, just as Bathykles who was pursuing him was about to lay
            hold of him, and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell
            heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the Achaeans with grief
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>], [600] while the Trojans were exultant, and
            came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their prowess,
            bore straight down upon them. </p>
          <p>Meriones then killed a helmeted warrior of the Trojans, Laogonos son of Onetor, [605]
            who was priest of Zeus of Mount Ida, <seg rend="subscript">605</seg> and he got honor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] from the locale [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>], like a god. Meriones struck him under the jaw and ear, so that life
            went out of him and the darkness of death laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear
            at Meriones, hoping to hit him under the shield as he was advancing, [610] but Meriones
            saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the
            point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Arēs robbed it of
            its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas’ hand in vain and fell quivering to
            the ground. [615] Aeneas was angry and said, “Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I
            had hit you my spear would soon have made an end of you.” </p>
          <p>And Meriones the spear-famed answered, [620] “Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will
            not be able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are only a mortal
            like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of your shield with my spear,
            however strong and self-confident you may be, I should soon vanquish you, [625] and you
            would yield your life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] to Hādēs of the
            noble steeds.” Then the son of Menoitios rebuked him and said, “Meriones, hero though
            you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good friend, will not make the
            Trojans draw away from the dead body; some of them must go under ground first; the
            outcome [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] of battle is in the force of hands,
            [630] while the outcome of deliberation is words; fight, therefore, and say
            nothing.” </p>
          <p>He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. <seg rend="subscript"
              >633</seg> Like the noise that arises from woodcutters <seg rend="subscript"
            >634</seg> in the folds of the mountain, and the hearing is from afar [= and the sound
            comes from afar], [635] even such a din now rose from earth-clash of bronze armor and of
            good ox-hide shields, as men smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at
            both ends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, [640] so covered was he
            from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies
            that buzz round the full milk-pails in the season [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hōrā</foreign>] of spring when they are brimming with milk—even so did they gather
            round godlike Sarpedon; nor did Zeus turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the
            fight, [645] but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill
            Patroklos, and considering whether glorious Hector should be allowed to end him now in
            the fight round the body of Sarpedon, [650] and strip him of his armor, or whether he
            should let him give yet further trouble [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] to
            the Trojans. In the end, he thought it best that <seg rend="subscript">653</seg> until
            the good <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign> of Achilles, son of Peleus should
            drive bronze-helmeted Hector and the Trojans back towards the city and take the lives of
            many. [655] First, therefore, he made Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his
            chariot and fled, telling the other Trojans to flee also, for he saw that the scales of
            Zeus had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; [660] they were
            dismayed when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of corpses—for
            when the son of Kronos made the fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans,
            therefore stripped the gleaming armor from his shoulders and the brave son of Menoitios
            gave it to his men to take to the ships. [665] Then Zeus lord of the storm-cloud said to
            Apollo, “Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons;
            cleanse the black blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may
            wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, [670] and clothe him in immortal
            raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and
            Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the fertile district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>] of Lycia, <seg rend="subscript">674</seg> and there his relatives
            and comrades will ritually prepare [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tarkhuein</foreign>] him,
            [675] with a tomb and a stele—for that is the privilege of the dead.”</p>
          <p>Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and came down from the heights of Ida
            into the thick of the fight; right away he took radiant Sarpedon out of range of the
            weapons, and then bore him a long way off, where he washed him in the river, [680]
            anointed him with ambrosia and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed
            him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death and Sleep, who presently set him down
            in the fertile district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Lycia. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile Patroklos, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon, [685] pursued
            the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the
            bidding of the son of Peleus, he would have escaped death and have been unscathed; but
            the thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Zeus passes man’s
            understanding; [690] he will put even a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his
            grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit
            into the heart of Patroklos. </p>
          <p>Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroklos, when the gods had now
            called you to meet your doom? First Adrastos, Autonoos, Ekheklos, [695] Perimos, the son
            of Megas, Epistor and Melanippos; after these he killed Elasos, Moulios, and Pylartes.
            These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">698</seg> The sons of the Achaeans could now have taken Troy <seg
              rend="subscript">699</seg> by the hands of Patroklos, for he was raging in all
            directions with his spear, [700] if Phoebus Apollo had not made his stand at the
            well-built wall, <seg rend="subscript">701</seg> standing there and thinking destructive
            thoughts against him [= Patroklos], since he [= Apollo] was supporting the Trojans. <seg
              rend="subscript">702</seg> Three times did he [= Patroklos] reach the base of the high
              wall, <seg rend="subscript">703</seg>that is what Patroklos did, and three times was
            he beaten back by Apollo, <seg rend="subscript">704</seg> who struck with his own
            immortal hands the luminous shield [of Patroklos]. [705] But when he [= Patroklos]
            rushed ahead yet a fourth time, equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to a
            superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript"
              >706</seg> he [= Apollo] shouted to him with a terrifying voice and spoke winged
              words: <seg rend="subscript">707</seg> “Draw back, Patroklos, you who are descended
            from the gods in the sky. It is not your destiny [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aisa</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">708</seg> to destroy with your spear the city
            of the proud Trojans, <seg rend="subscript">709</seg> nor will it be the destiny of
            Achilles, who is a far better man than you are.” [710] That is what he [= Apollo] said.
            On hearing this, Patroklos drew quite a way back, <seg rend="subscript">711</seg> thus
            avoiding the anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of Apollo who shoots from
            afar.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates, in doubt whether
            to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call the army inside the gates. [715] As he
            was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty
            warrior Asios, who was uncle of Hector, breaker of horses, being brother to Hecuba, and
            son of Dymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarios; [720] in his
            likeness Zeus’ son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, “Hector, why have you left off
            fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than you, as I am worse,
            you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight towards Patroklos, if so be that
            Apollo may grant you a triumph over him, [725] and you may kill him.” </p>
          <p>With this the god went back into the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >ponos</foreign>], and Hector bade Kebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed
            in among them, [730] and struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector
            and the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but drove
            straight at Patroklos. <seg rend="subscript">733</seg> Then Patroklos, from one side,
            leapt from his chariot, hitting the ground, with a spear in his left hand, [735] and in
            his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,
            nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone
            struck Kebriones, Hector’s charioteer, a bastard son of glorious Priam, as he held the
            reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the forehead and drove his brows into his head
            for the bone was smashed, [740] and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped
            dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left in him.
            Over him did you then vaunt, O charioteer Patroklos, saying, [745] “Bless my heart, how
            active he is, and how well he dives. If we had been at sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>] this man would have dived from the ship’s side and brought up as
            many oysters as the whole crew could stomach, even in rough water, for he has dived
            beautifully off his chariot on to the ground. [750] It seems, then, that there are
            divers also among the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he flung himself on Kebriones with the spring, as it were, of a lion that
            while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the chest, and his courage is his own
            destruction—even so furiously, O Patroklos, did you then spring upon Kebriones. [755]
            Then Hector, from the other side, leapt from his chariot, hitting the ground. The pair
            then fought over the body of Kebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high
            mountain over the body of a stag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty
            warriors, [760] Patroklos son of Menoitios and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another
            over the corpse of Kebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got him by
            the head, while Patroklos kept fast hold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between
            the other Danaans and Trojans. [765] As the east and south wind buffet one another when
            they beat upon some dense forest on the mountains—there is beech and ash and spreading
            cornel; the tops of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one can hear the
            boughs cracking and breaking— [770] even so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one
            another and lay about each other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear
            fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body of
            Kebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his
            body, [775] but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely,
            heedless of his driving now. </p>
          <p>So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either side were alike
            deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down towards the time when men loose their
            oxen, [780] the Achaeans proved to be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew
            Kebriones out of range of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armor
            from his shoulders. <seg rend="subscript">783</seg> Then Patroklos rushed ahead toward
            the Trojans, with the worst intentions. <seg rend="subscript">784</seg> Three times he
            rushed at them, and he was equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atalantos</foreign>] to swift
            Arēs. [785] He [= Patroklos] was making a terrifying shout, and he killed three times
            nine men. <seg rend="subscript">786</seg> But when he [= Patroklos] rushed ahead for yet
            a fourth time, equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>] to a superhuman force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">787</seg> then, O
            Patroklos, the end of your life made its appearance to you. <seg rend="subscript"
              >788</seg> Facing you now was Phoebus [Apollo], ready to fight you in grim
              battle. <seg rend="subscript">789</seg> He [= Apollo] was terrifying. But he [=
            Patroklos] did not notice him as he [= Apollo] was coming at him in the heat of battle.
            [790] For he [= Apollo] was covered in a great cloud of mist as he made contact with
              him. <seg rend="subscript">791</seg> He [= Apollo] stood behind him and he struck him
            on his back and his broad shoulders <seg rend="subscript">792</seg> with the downturned
            flat of his hand, making his eyes spin. <seg rend="subscript">793</seg> His helmet was
            knocked off his head by Phoebus Apollo, <seg rend="subscript">794</seg> and it rolled
            rattling off under the horses’ hooves. [795] That is what happened to this helmet, and
            its horse-tail plumes were all begrimed <seg rend="subscript">796</seg> with blood and
            dust. Before this time, it was not sanctioned <seg rend="subscript">797</seg> that this
            horse-hair helmet should ever get begrimed in the dust, <seg rend="subscript"
            >798</seg> while it was protecting the head and comely forehead of that godlike
              man, <seg rend="subscript">799</seg> protecting the head of Achilles. But now Zeus
            gave it to Hector [800] for him to wear on his head. And his [= Hector’s] destruction
            was near. <seg rend="subscript">801</seg> Broken completely in his [= Patroklos’] hands
            was that spear of his that casts a long shadow, <seg rend="subscript">802</seg> a huge
            and heavy and massive piece of weaponry, and from his shoulders <seg rend="subscript"
              >803</seg> his shield, strap and all, fell to the ground, with its beautiful
              edgework. <seg rend="subscript">804</seg> Taken away from him was his breastplate,
            removed by lord Apollo, son of Zeus.</p>
          <p>[805] And his [= Patroklos’] mind was seized by derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >atē</foreign>]; his limbs failed him, <seg rend="subscript">806</seg> and he just
            stood there in a daze. Whereupon Euphorbos, son of Panthoös, a Dardanian, the best
            spearman of his time, as also the finest charioteer and fleetest runner, came behind him
            and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. [810] This man as
            soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient
            was he in all the arts of war—he it was, O charioteer Patroklos, that first drove a
            weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbos then ran back into the
            crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; [815] he would not stand firm and
            wait for Patroklos, unarmed though he now was, to attack him; but Patroklos unnerved,
            alike by the blow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of
            his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving
            ground, [820] forced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him in
            the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so
            that he fell heavily to the ground to the great dismay of the Achaeans. As when a lion
            has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him—the two fight furiously upon the
            mountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink, [825] and the lion
            has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe—even so did Hector son of Priam take the
            life of the brave son of Menoitios who had killed so many, striking him from close at
            hand, and vaunting over him the while. [830] “Patroklos,” said he, “you thought that you
            should ransack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in
            your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining
            their utmost to defend them. [835] I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the
            day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch,
            Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I think—when you left him he
            charged you strictly, saying, ‘Come not back to the ships, charioteer Patroklos, [840]
            till you have rent the bloodstained khiton of manslaughtering Hector about his body.’
            Thus I think—did he charge you, and your fool’s heart answered him ‘yes’ within
            you.”</p>
          <p>Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O charioteer Patroklos: “Hector,
            vaunt as you will, for Zeus the son of Kronos and Apollo have granted you victory; [845]
            it is they who have vanquished me so easily, and they who have stripped the armor from
            my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen
            before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men
            Euphorbos; [850] you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and
            lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little season; death and the
            day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles
            descendant of Aiakos.”</p>
          <p>[855] When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in the fulfillment [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] of death, his life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] left his body and flitted down to the house of Hādēs, mourning its
            sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though he was,
            glorious Hector still spoke to him saying, “Patroklos, why should you thus foretell my
            doom? [860] Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely-haired Thetis, may be smitten by my
            spear and die before me?” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his foot upon the body,
            which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He then went spear in hand after Automedon,
            [865] attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of the fleet descendant of
            Aiakos, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the gods had given
            as a rich gift to Peleus bore Automedon swiftly from the field. [867] </p>

          <head>Rhapsody 17</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1]Brave Menelaos son of Atreus now came to know that Patroklos had
            fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armor to bestride him. [5]
            As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so did yellow-haired Menelaos bestride
            Patroklos. He held his round shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any
            who should dare face him. [10] But the son of Panthoös had also noted the body, and came
            up to Menelaos saying, “Menelaos, son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the
            bloodstained spoils be. [15] I was first of the Trojans and their brave allies to drive
            my spear into Patroklos, let me, therefore, have my full glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>] among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill you.” </p>
          <p>To this Menelaos answered in great anger “By father Zeus, boasting is an ill thing.
            [20] The leopard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage wild-boar, which is fiercest
            and most dauntless of all creatures, than are the proud sons of Panthoös. Yet Hyperenor,
            breaker of horses, [25] did not see out the days of his youth when he made light of me
            and withstood me, deeming me the meanest warrior among the Danaans. His own feet never
            bore him back to gladden his wife and parents. [30] Even so shall I make an end of you
            too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not face me, or it shall be
            worse for you. Even a fool may be wise after the event.” </p>
          <p>Euphorbos would not listen, and said, “Now indeed, Menelaos, shall you pay for the
            death of my brother over whom you vaunted, [35] and whose wife you widowed in her bridal
            chamber, while you brought grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]
            unspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your head and
            armor [40] and place them in the hands of Panthoös and noble Phrontis. The time is come
            when this matter shall be fought out in a struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] and settled, for me or against me.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he struck Menelaos full on the shield, but the spear did not go through,
            for the shield turned its point. [45] Menelaos then took aim, praying to father Zeus as
            he did so; Euphorbos was drawing back, and Menelaos struck him about the roots of his
            throat, leaning his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went
            clean through his neck, [50] and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to
            the ground. <seg rend="subscript">51</seg> With blood bedewed was his hair, looking like
            myrtle-blossoms [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharites</foreign>],<ptr type="footnote"
              xml:id="noteref_n.3" target="n.3"/> <seg rend="subscript">52</seg> with the curls and
            all so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold. As one who has grown a fine young olive
            tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water— [55] the plant is full of
            promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts forth its white
            blossoms till the blasts of some fierce wind sweep down upon it and level it with the
            ground—even so did Menelaos strip the fair youth Euphorbos of his armor after he had
            slain him. [60] Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of his strength
            fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding—first he breaks her neck with
            his strong jaws, and then gorges on her blood and entrails; [65] dogs and shepherds
            raise a hue and cry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him,
            for they are pale with fear—even so no one had the courage to face valiant Menelaos.
            [70] The son of Atreus would have then carried off the armor of the son of Panthoös with
            ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Kikones
            incited Hector to attack him. [75] “Hector,” said he, “you are now going after the
            horses of the noble descendant of Aiakos, but you will not take them; they cannot be
            kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son to an immortal
            mother. [80] Meanwhile Menelaos, warlike son of Atreus, has bestridden the body of
            Patroklos and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbos, son of Panthoös, so that he
            can fight no more.” </p>
          <p>The god then went back into the toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and
            turmoil, but the spirit of Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]; he looked along the ranks [85] and saw Euphorbos
            lying on the ground with the blood still flowing from his wound, and Menelaos stripping
            him of his armor. Then he made his way to the front <seg rend="subscript"
            >88</seg> looking like the flame of Hesphaistos, <seg rend="subscript"
            >89</seg> unquenchable, clad in his gleaming armor, and crying with a loud voice. When
            the son of Atreus heard him, [90] angered, he said tο his great-hearted <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>, “Alas! what shall I do? I may not let the Trojans
            take the armor of Patroklos who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who
            sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if for the sake of my honor [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed, [95]
            they will prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force. Why, however,
            should I thus hesitate? <seg rend="subscript">98</seg> When a man is willing,
            face-to-face with a daimōn, to fight another man <seg rend="subscript">99</seg> whom the
            god honors, then it becomes a sure thing that a big pain [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pēma</foreign>] will roll down [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kulindesthai</foreign>] upon
            him. [100] Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the hand of the
            gods gives him honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>]. Yet, if I could find
            Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and any superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] too, if we might only save the body of Patroklos for
            Achilles son of Peleus. [105] This, of many evils, would be the least.” </p>
          <p>While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector at their head;
            he therefore drew back and left the body, turning about like some bearded lion [110] who
            is being chased by dogs and men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he
            is daunted and slinks sulkily off—even so did Menelaos, fair-haired son of Atreus, turn
            and leave the body of Patroklos. When among the body of his men, [115] he looked around
            for mighty Ajax, son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight,
            cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had
            spread a great panic among them. He ran up to him and said, [120] “Ajax, my good friend,
            come with me at once to dead Patroklos, if so be that we may take the body to
            Achilles—as for his armor, Hector already has it.” </p>
          <p>These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the front ranks,
            Menelaos going with him. [125] Hector of the shining helmet had stripped Patroklos of
            his armor, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the body to fling
            before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his shield like a wall before him, on
            which Hector withdrew under shelter of his men, [130] and sprang on to his chariot,
            giving the armor over to the Trojans to take to the city, as a great glory [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered the body of
            Patroklos with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if
            hunters have come upon him in a forest when he is with his little ones— [135] in the
            pride and fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his
            eyes—even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroklos, and by his side stood warlike
            Menelaos, son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >penthos</foreign>] in his heart.</p>
          <p>[140] Then Glaukos, son of Hippolokhos, looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked him
            sternly. “Hector,” said he, “you make a brave show, but in fight you are sadly wanting.
            A runaway like yourself has no claim to so great a glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kleos</foreign>]. Think how you may now save your town and citadel [145] by the hands
            of your own people born in Ilion; for you will get no Lycians to fight for you, seeing
            what thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do
            anything to help a man of less note, [150] after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your
            guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived
            he did good favor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] both to your city and to
            yourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will
            listen to me, [155] they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If the Trojans had any
            of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold of men who are engaging in the struggle
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] for their land and harassing those who
            would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroklos into Ilion. [160] Could we get this
            dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up
            the armor of Sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. For he who was <seg
              rend="subscript">164</seg> killed was the attendant <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign> of such a man who is by far the best [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aristos</foreign>] at the ships of the Achaeans— [165] he and his close-fighting
            followers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>]. Nevertheless you dared not
            make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he
            is a braver man than you are.” </p>
          <p>Hector scowled at him and answered, [170] “Glaukos, you should know better. I have held
            you so far as a man of more understanding than any in all Lycia, but now I despise you
            for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. [175] I fear neither battle nor the din of
            chariots, but the thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of Zeus is stronger
            than ours; Zeus at one time makes even a strong man draw back and snatches victory from
            his grasp, while at another he will set him on to fight. Come here then, my friend,
            stand by me [180] and see indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through
            as you say, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans from fighting
            round the body of Patroklos.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians,
            fighters in close combat, [185] be men, my friends, and fight might and main, while I
            put on the goodly armor of blameless Achilles, which I took when I killed
            Patroklos.” </p>
          <p>With this Hector of the shining helmet left the fight, [190] and ran full speed after
            his men who were taking the armor of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got far. Standing
            for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed his armor. His own he sent to the
            strong city of Ilion and to the Trojans, while <seg rend="subscript">194</seg> he put on
            the immortalizing armor [95] of Achilles son of Peleus, which the skydwelling gods <seg
              rend="subscript">196</seg> gave to his father [= Peleus] near and dear. And he had
            given it to his son [= Achilles] <seg rend="subscript">197</seg> when he grew old. But
            the son himself never reached old age wearing the armor of his father. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">198</seg> He [= Hector] was seen from afar by Zeus, gatherer of
              clouds. <seg rend="subscript">199</seg> There he [= Hector] was, all fitted out in the
            armor of the godlike son of Peleus. [200] Then he [= Zeus] moved his head and spoke to
            himself [= to his own <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
              >201</seg> “Ah, you [= Hector] are a pitiful wretch. Your own death is not on your
            mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>]— <seg rend="subscript">202</seg> a
            death that is coming near.<ptr type="footnote" xml:id="noteref_n.4" target="n.4"/> There
            you are, putting on the immortalizing armor <seg rend="subscript">203</seg> of a man who
            is champion, one who makes all others tremble. <seg rend="subscript">204</seg> It was
            his comrade you killed, gentle he was and strong, [205] and his armor, in a way that
            went against the order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kosmos</foreign>] of things, from his
            head and shoulders <seg rend="subscript">206</seg> you took. All the same, I will for
            now put in your hands great power [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kratos</foreign>]. <seg
              rend="subscript">207</seg> As a compensation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >poinē</foreign>] for this, you will never return home from the battle. <seg
              rend="subscript">208</seg>Never will you bring home, for Andromache to receive, the
            famed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kluta</foreign>] armor of Peleus’ son.”</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">209</seg> So spoke the son of Kronos, and with his eyebrows of
            azure he made a reinforcing [= <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">epi-</foreign>] nod. [210] He [=
            Zeus] fitted the armor to Hector’s skin, and he [= Hector] was entered by Arēs <seg
              rend="subscript">211</seg> the terrifying, the Enyalios. And his [= Hector’s] limbs
            were all filled inside <seg rend="subscript">212</seg> with force and strength. Seeking
            to join up with his famed allies <seg rend="subscript">213</seg> he went off, making a
            great war cry. He was quite the picture for them all. <seg rend="subscript">214</seg> He
            was shining in the armor of the man with the great heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>], the son of Peleus. [215] He went about among them and cheered them
            on—Mesthles, Glaukos, Medon, Thersilokhos, Asteropaios, Deisenor and Hippothoös,
            Phorkys, Chromios, and Ennomos the augur. All these did he exhort saying, [220] “Hear
            me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have
            a crowd about me that I called you here each from his several city, but that with heart
            and spirit you might defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from the fierce
            Achaeans. [225] For this do I oppress my people with your food and the presents that
            make you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of
            war; whoever shall bring Patroklos, dead though he be, [230] into the hands of the
            Trojans, breakers of horses, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give him
            one half of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like glory [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] with myself.” </p>
          <p>When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans with their spears
            held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high [235] that he should force Ajax son
            of Telamon to yield up the body—fools that they were, for he was about to take the lives
            of many. Then Ajax said to Menelaos, “My good friend Menelaos, you and I shall hardly
            come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body of Patroklos, [240] who
            will shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for the safety of my
            own head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter,
            and our destruction seems now certain. [245] Call then upon the princes of the Danaans
            if there is any who can hear us.” </p>
          <p>Menelaos of the great war cry did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at
            the top of his voice. “My friends,” he cried, “princes and counselors of the Argives,
            all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaos drink at the public cost, [250] and give orders
            each to his own people as Zeus grants him power and honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >tīmē</foreign>], the fight is so thick about me that I cannot distinguish you
            severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, [255] and think it shame that
            Patroklos should become meat and morsel for Trojan hounds.” </p>
          <p>Fleet Ajax, son of Oïleus, heard him and was first to force his way through the fight
            and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones, his attendant, peer of
            manslaughtering Arēs. [260] As for the others that came into the fight after these, who
            of his own self could name them? </p>
          <p>The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great wave that comes
            thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river, [265] and the rocks that jut into
            the sea ring with the roar of the breakers that beat and buffet them—even with such a
            roar did the Trojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about
            the son of Menoitios, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Zeus, moreover, hid the
            brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, [270] for he had borne no grudge against
            the son of Menoitios while he was still alive and attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign>] to the descendant of Aiakos; therefore he was loath to let him
            fall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend
            him. </p>
          <p>At first the Trojans drove the glancing-eyed Achaeans back, [275] and they withdrew
            from the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one, nevertheless
            they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of
            all the Danaans after the blameless son of Peleus alike in stature and prowess, [280]
            quickly rallied them and made towards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when
            he stands at bay in the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have
            attacked him— [285] even so did glorious Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the
            phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroklos and were most bent
            on winning glory by dragging him off to their city. At this moment Hippothoös, brave son
            of the Pelasgian Lethos, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body
            off by the foot through the press of the fight, [290] having bound a strap round the
            sinews near the ankle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none of those could
            save him who would have gladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote
            him on his bronze-cheeked helmet. [295] The plumed headpiece broke about the point of
            the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the
            bloody brain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then failed him and
            he let great-hearted Patroklos’ foot drop from his hand, [300] as he fell full length
            dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and never repaid
            his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut short early by the spear
            of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at Ajax with a spear, [305] but he saw it coming
            and just managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Skhedios son of noble
            Iphitos, leader of the Phocians, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over many
            people; it struck him under the middle of the collar-bone [310] the bronze point went
            right through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armor rang
            rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck noble
            Phorkys, high-spirited son of Phainops, in the middle of the belly as he was bestriding
            Hippothoös, and broke the plate of his cuirass; [315] whereon the spear tore out his
            entrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hector and those
            who were in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised a loud cry of
            triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorkys and Hippothoös which they stripped presently
            of their armor. </p>
          <p>The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and driven back to Ilion
            [320] through their own cowardice, while the Argives, so great was their courage and
            endurance, would have achieved a triumph even against the will of Zeus, if Apollo had
            not roused Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas, son of Epytos, an attendant who had
            grown old in the service [325] of Aeneas’ aged father, and was at all times devoted to
            him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, “Aeneas, can you not manage, even though the
            gods be against us, to save high Ilion? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and
            self-reliance have saved their population [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] in
            spite of Zeus, [330] whereas in this case he would much rather give victory to us than
            to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being so terribly afraid.” </p>
          <p>Aeneas knew far-striking Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to Hector
            saying, [335] “Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aidōs</foreign>] on us if we are beaten by the warlike Achaeans and driven back to
            Ilion through our own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Zeus the
            supreme disposer will be with us. [340] Therefore let us make for the Danaans, that it
            may go hard with them before they bear away dead Patroklos to the ships. </p>
          <p>As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied and again faced
            the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiokritos, son of Arisbas, [345] a valiant follower of
            Lykomedes, and Lykomedes was moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close
            up, and speared Apisaon, son of Hippasos, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the
            midriff, so that he died; [350] he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best man of
            them all after Asteropaios. Warlike Asteropaios flew forward to avenge him and attack
            the Danaans, but this might no longer be, [355] Inasmuch as those about Patroklos were
            well covered by their shields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had
            given them strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before
            the others, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight hand to hand.
            [360] Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell
            thick on one another alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of the
            Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though many fewer of them
            perished, [365] through the care they took to defend and stand by one another.</p>
          <p>Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though it had gone hard
            even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over all that part where the bravest
            heroes were fighting about the dead son of Menoitios, [370] whereas the other Danaans
            and strong-greaved Achaeans fought at their ease in full daylight with radiant sunshine
            all round them, and there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.
            [375] These last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for they were
            some distance apart and beyond the range of one another’s weapons, whereas those who
            were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and darkness. All the best of
            them were being worn out by the great weight of their armor, but the two valiant heroes,
            Thrasymedes and Antilokhos, had not yet heard of the death of Patroklos the blameless,
            [380] and believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the Trojans; they
            were keeping themselves in reserve against the death or rout of their own comrades, for
            so Nestor had ordered when he sent them from the ships into battle.</p>
          <p>[385] Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat of their
            toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their hands and eyes, as they fought
            over the attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of the fleet son of
            Peleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide [390] all drenched in fat to his men,
            and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug till the
            moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is well
            stretched—even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the
            compass of but a little space— [395] the Trojans steadfastly set on dragging it into
            Ilion, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was
            the fight between them. Not Arēs himself the lord of armies, nor yet Athena, even in
            their fullest fury could make light of such a battle. </p>
          <p>[400] Such fearful turmoil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] of men and horses
            did Zeus on that day ordain round the body of Patroklos. Meanwhile Achilles did not know
            that he had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off the ships.
            [405] He had no idea, therefore, that Patroklos was dead, and thought that he would
            return alive as soon as he had gone close up to the gates. He knew that he was not to
            ransack the city neither with nor without himself, for his mother had often told him
            this when he had sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of great
            Zeus. [410] Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in
            the death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his comrades. </p>
          <p>The others still kept on charging one another round the body with their pointed spears
            and killing each other. Then would one say, [415] “My friends, we can never again show
            our faces at the ships—better, and greatly better, that earth should open and swallow us
            here in this place, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing off
            Patroklos to their city.”</p>
          <p>[420] The high-hearted Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,
            “Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from fighting.” With
            such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought, [425] and an iron clank
            rose through the void air to the brazen vault of the heavens. The horses of the
            descendant of Aiakos stood out of the fight and wept when they heard that their driver
            had been laid low by the hand of manslaughtering Hector. Automedon, valiant son of
            Diores, [430] lashed them again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and
            many a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to the ships by the
            waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood with
            their chariot stock still, [435] as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or
            woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they
            mourned the loss of their charioteer, [440] and their noble manes drooped all wet from
            under the yokestraps on either side the yoke. </p>
          <p>The son of Kronos saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged his head, and
            muttered to himself, saying, “Poor things, why did we give you to King Peleus who is a
            mortal, while you are yourselves ageless and immortal? [445] Was it that you might share
            the sorrows that befall humankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the
            earth there is none so pitiable as he is—still, Hector, son of Priam, shall drive
            neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it. [450] It is enough that he should have
            the armor over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore I will give you strength of heart
            and limb to bear Automedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans
            triumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships; [455] whereon night
            shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">456</seg> So saying he [Zeus] breathed good power [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] into the horses  so that they shook the dust from out
            of their manes, and bore their chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans
            and Achaeans. [460] Behind them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a
            vulture amid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he dashed amid
            the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, [465]
            for he could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone in the chariot;
            at last, however, a comrade, Alkimedon, son of Laerkes son of Haimon caught sight of him
            and came up behind his chariot. “Automedon,” said he, “what god has put this folly into
            your heart [470] and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the Trojans in the
            front rank single-handed? He who was your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on
            being armed in the armor of the descendant of Aiakos.” </p>
          <p>Automedon, son of Diores, answered, [475] “Alkimedon, there is no one else who can
            control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save only Patroklos—while he
            was alive—peer of gods in counsel. <seg rend="subscript">479</seg> But you [=
            Alkimedon], take this whip and these splendid reins, [480] take them, while I [=
            Automedon] step off [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">apobainein</foreign>] from the chariot, so
            that I may fight.”</p>
          <p>Alkimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins, while Automedon
            leaped from off the car. When glorious Hector saw him he said to Aeneas who was near
            him, [485] “Aeneas, counselor of the mail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet
            descendant of Aiakos come into battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you
            think well, that we might take them; [490] they will not dare face us if we both attack
            them.” </p>
          <p>The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went right on, with
            their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze.
            Chromios and godlike Aretos went also with them, [495] and their hearts beat high with
            hope that they might kill the men and capture the horses—fools that they were, for they
            were not to return unscathed from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to father
            Zeus and was right away filled with courage and strength abounding. [500] He turned to
            his trusty comrade Alkimedon and said, “Alkimedon, keep your horses so close up that I
            may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam
            till he has killed us [505] and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread
            panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among the foremost.” </p>
          <p>Then he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaos, “Ajaxes leaders of the Argives, and
            Menelaos, give the dead body over to them that are best able to defend it, [510] and
            come to the rescue of us living; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among
            the Trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies
            on the lap of the gods, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to Zeus.”</p>
          <p>[515] He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round shield of
            Aretos, and went right through it for the shield stayed it not, so that it was driven
            through his belt into the lower part of his belly. [520] As when some sturdy youth, axe
            in hand, deals his blow behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of
            its neck so that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretos give one bound
            and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of him.
            [525] Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and stooped forward to
            avoid it, so that it flew past him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end
            went on quivering till Arēs robbed it of its force. [530] They would then have fought
            hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their way through the crowd when
            they heard their comrade calling, and parted them for all their fury—for Hector, Aeneas,
            and godlike Chromios were afraid and drew back, [535] leaving Aretos to lie there struck
            to the heart. Automedon, peer of fleet Arēs, then stripped him of his armor and vaunted
            over him saying, “I have done little to assuage my sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>] for the son of Menoitios, for the man I have killed is not so good
            as he was.”</p>
          <p>[540] As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his chariot; then
            he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped in gore as a lion that has been
            gorging upon a bull. </p>
          <p>And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroklos, for Athena came down
            from the heavens [545] and roused its fury by the command of far-seeing Zeus, who had
            changed his mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] and sent her to encourage the
            Danaans. As when Zeus bends his bright bow in the heavens in token to humankind either
            of war or of the chill storms that stay men from their labor and plague the flocks—even
            so, [550] wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Athena go in among the army and speak man
            by man to each. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix [555] and spoke to strong
            Menelaos son of Atreus, who was standing near her. “Menelaos,” said she, “it will be
            shame and dishonor to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of Achilles under the walls of
            Troy. [560] Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so also.” </p>
          <p>Menelaos of the great war cry answered, “Phoenix, my good old friend, may Athena grant
            me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by Patroklos and defend
            him; his death has gone to my heart, [565] but Hector is as a raging fire and deals his
            blows without ceasing, for Zeus is now granting him a time of triumph.” </p>
          <p>Owl-vision Athena was pleased at his having named herself before any of the other gods.
            Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders, [570] and made him as bold as a
            fly, which, though driven off will yet come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it
            love man’s blood—even so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroklos and
            threw his spear. [575] Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eëtion,
            who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest honor in the district
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>], for he was his comrade and boon companion;
            the spear of Menelaos struck this man in the belt just as he had turned in flight, and
            went right through him. [580] Whereon he fell heavily forward, and fair-haired Menelaos,
            son of Atreus, drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his own people. </p>
          <p>Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the likeness of Phainops
            son of Asios who lived in Abydos and was the most favored of all Hector’s guests. [585]
            In his likeness far-striking Apollo said, “Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you
            henceforward now that you have quailed before Menelaos who has ever been rated poorly as
            a warrior? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, [590] and
            has slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes, son of
            Eëtion.” </p>
          <p>A dark cloud of grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] fell upon Hector as he
            heard, and he made his way to the front clad in full armor. Then the son of Kronos
            seized his bright tasseled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: [595] he sent forth his
            lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave victory to the Trojans
            and routed the Achaeans. </p>
          <p>The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his face turned ever
            towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear
            thrown by Polydamas had grazed the top of the bone, [600] for Polydamas had come up to
            him and struck him from close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitos, son of
            noble Alektryon, in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fighting further. He
            looked about him in dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle
            with the Trojans. [605] While Hector was in pursuit of Leitos, Idomeneus struck him on
            the breastplate over his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and
            the Trojans cheered aloud. <seg rend="subscript">608</seg> He [= Hector] threw his spear
            at Idomeneus son of Deukalion. <seg rend="subscript">609</seg> He [= Idomeneus] was
            standing in his chariot. He [= Hector] just barely missed his target. [610] Instead, he
            struck the follower [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">opāōn</foreign>] and charioteer [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">hēniokhos</foreign>] of Mērionēs, <seg rend="subscript"
            >611</seg> Koiranos was the man’s name, who had followed [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hepesthai</foreign>] him [= Mērionēs], coming from the city of Lyktos. <seg
              rend="subscript">612</seg> For he [= Mērionēs], from the start, had come [to the
            battleground] on foot when he had come away from the ships with their curved prows and
              sterns. <seg rend="subscript">613</seg> That is how he [= Mērionēs] had come. And he
            [= Mērionēs] would have handed over to the Trojans a mighty victory [if he had been the
            one who got killed, and] <seg rend="subscript">614</seg> if Koiranos had not been the
            one who drove with speed the swift horses. [615] He [= Koiranos] had come as a light of
            salvation for him [= Mērionēs], preventing this day from becoming the pitiless day [of
            death] for him [= Mērionēs], <seg rend="subscript">616</seg> while he himself [=
            Koiranos] lost his own life at the hands of Hector, slayer of men. <seg rend="subscript"
              >617</seg> Yes, he [= Hector] struck him [= Koiranos], hitting him right under the jaw
            and ears. His teeth were pried loose, <seg rend="subscript">618</seg> pushed in by the
            tip of the spear, which split his tongue right down the middle. <seg rend="subscript"
              >619</seg> He fell from the chariot, dropping the reins to the ground. [620] But
            Mērionēs picked them up in his hands, <seg rend="subscript">621</seg> having leaned
            over, from the ground, and he spoke these words to Idomeneus: <seg rend="subscript"
              >622</seg> “Give the horses a lash of the whip right now and keep whipping them until
            you get all the way back to the swift ships. <seg rend="subscript">623</seg> Even you
            must know by now that victory no longer belongs to the Achaeans.” <seg rend="subscript"
              >624</seg> That is what he [= Mērionēs] said, and Idomeneus gave the horses with the
            beautiful manes a lash of the whip [625] as they sped toward the hollow ships, since by
            now his spirit was invaded by fear.</p>
          <p>Great-hearted Ajax and Menelaos noted how Zeus had turned the scale in favor of the
            Trojans, and huge Ajax was first to speak. “Alas,” said he, [630] “even a fool may see
            that father Zeus is helping the Trojans. All their weapons strike home; no matter
            whether it be a brave man or a coward that hurls them, Zeus speeds all alike, whereas
            ours fall each one of them without effect. [635] What, then, will be best both as
            regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving
            as they look in this direction; for they will make sure that nothing can now check the
            terrible hands of manslaughtering Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships.
            [640] I wish that some one would go and tell the son of Peleus at once, for I do not
            think he can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But
            I can see not a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike
            hidden in darkness. [645] O father Zeus, lift this cloud from over the sons of the
            Achaeans; make the heavens serene, and let us see; if you will that we perish, let us
            fall at any rate by daylight.” </p>
          <p>Father Zeus heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Right away he chased away the
            cloud of darkness, [650] so that the sun shone out and all the fighting was revealed.
            Ajax then said to Menelaos of the great war cry, “Look, illustrious Menelaos, and if
            Antilokhos, son of great-hearted Nestor, be still living, send him at once to tell the
            high-spirited Achilles [655] that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades has
            fallen.”</p>
          <p>Menelaos heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard—the lion is tired
            of attacking the men and hounds, [660] who keep watch the whole night through and will
            not let him feast on the fat of their herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at
            them but in vain, for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt
            him for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away— [665] even so did
            Menelaos of he great war cry sorely against his will leave Patroklos, in great fear lest
            the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of the foe.
            He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes, strictly saying, [670] “Ajaxes and Meriones,
            leaders of the Argives, now indeed remember how good Patroklos was; he was ever
            courteous while alive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.” </p>
          <p>With this fair-haired Menelaos left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,
            [675] whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird—however high he may be
            in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him by crouching under bush or thicket,
            for he will swoop down upon it and make an end of it— [680] even so, O illustrious
            Menelaos, did your keen eyes range round the mighty army of your followers to see if you
            could find the son of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaos saw him on the extreme left
            of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight boldly. Menelaos the
            fair-haired went up to him and said, [685] “Antilokhos, come here that you may
              learn <seg rend="subscript">686</seg> of the ghastly news, which should never have
              happened. <seg rend="subscript">687</seg> Once you see it with your own eyes <seg
              rend="subscript">688</seg> you will know that the god is letting roll down from above
            a pain [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pēma</foreign>] upon the Danaans [= Achaeans], <seg
              rend="subscript">689</seg> and victory now belongs to the Trojans. He has just been
            killed, the best of the Achaeans, [690] I mean, Patroklos, and the Danaans [= Achaeans]
            will have a great longing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pothē</foreign>]. Run instantly to
            the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue the body and bear it to the
            ships. As for the armor, Hector already has it.”</p>
          <p>[695] Antilokhos was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless; his eyes
            filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he did as Menelaos had said, and
            set off running as soon as he had given his armor to a comrade, blameless Laodokos, who
            was wheeling his horses round, close beside him.</p>
          <p>[700] Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news to Achilles
            son of Peleus. Nor were you, O illustrious Menelaos, minded to help his harassed
            comrades, when Antilokhos had left the Pylians—and greatly did they miss him— [705] but
            he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself went back to Patroklos. He came running up
            to the two Ajaxes and said, “I have sent Antilokhos to the ships to tell swift-footed
            Achilles, but rage against radiant Hector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight
            without armor. What then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and
            our own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?”</p>
          <p>[715] Huge Ajax answered, “Renowned Menelaos, you have said well: do you, then, and
            Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>], while we two behind you keep off glorious Hector and
            the Trojans, [720] one in heart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with
            one another.” </p>
          <p>Then Menelaos and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and lifted him high aloft
            with a great effort. The Trojan army raised a hue and cry behind them when they saw the
            Achaeans bearing the body away, [725] and flew after them like hounds attacking a
            wounded boar in the hunt of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him
            as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in a fury,
            scaring and scattering them in all directions— [730] even so did the Trojans for a while
            charge in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed at both the ends, but when
            the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared press
            on to fight further about the dead.</p>
          <p>[735] In this way—did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body to the ships
            out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce flames that when once kindled
            spread like wildfire over a city, and the houses fall in the glare of its burning— [740]
            even such was the roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore
            Patroklos from the field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw some
            beam or great piece of ship’s timber down a rough mountain-track, [745] and they pant
            and sweat as they, go even so did Menelaos and Meriones pant and sweat as they bore the
            body of Patroklos. Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded
            mountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water [750] and check the flow
            even of a great river, nor is there any stream strong enough to break through it—even so
            did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they
            kept pouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with
            valiant Hector. [755] As a flock of daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering
            when they see a falcon, foe to small birds, come soaring near them, even so did the
            Achaean youth raise a mix of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of
            their former prowess. [760] In the rout of the Danaans much goodly armor fell round
            about the trench, and of fighting there was no end.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 18</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the
            fleet runner Antilokhos, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles, and found him
            sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was indeed too surely true. [5]
              “Alas,” <seg rend="subscript">5</seg> angered, he said tο his great-hearted <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>, “why are the flowing-haired Achaeans again scouring
            the plain and flocking towards the ships? May the gods be not now bringing that sorrow
            upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, [10] saying that while I was yet alive the
            bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans, and see the light of the sun no
            longer. I fear the brave son of Menoitios has fallen through his own daring, and yet I
            bade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were bringing fire
            against them, and not join battle with Hector.”</p>
          <p>[15] As he was thus pondering, the son of stately Nestor came up to him and told his
            sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. “Alas,” he cried, “son of noble Peleus, I bring
            you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue. [20] Patroklos has fallen, and a
            fight is raging about his naked body—for Hector of the shining helmet holds his
            armor.” </p>
          <p>A dark cloud of grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] fell upon Achilles as
            he listened. He filled both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his
            head, disfiguring his comely face, [25] and letting the refuse settle over his khiton so
            fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at full length, and tore his
            hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom Achilles and Patroklos had taken captive wailed
            aloud for grief, [30] beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for
            sorrow. Antilokhos bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay
            groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into his own throat. Then valiant
            Achilles gave a loud cry [35] and his mother heard him as she was sitting in the depths
            of the sea by the old man her father, whereon she wailed, and all the goddesses
            daughters of Nereus that dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There
            were Glauke, Thalia and Kymodoke, [40] Nesaia, Speo, Thoe, and dark-eyed Halie,
            Kymothoe, Aktaia and Limnorea, Melite, Iaira, Amphithoe and Agaue, Doto and Proto,
            Pherousa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and Kallianeira, [45] Doris, Panope, and the
            famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and Kallianassa. There were also Klymene,
            Ianeira and Ianassa, Maira, Oreithuia and lovely-haired Amatheia of the lovely locks,
            with other Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. [50] The crystal cave was filled
            with their multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them in their
            lament. </p>
          <p>“Listen,” she cried, “sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear the burden of my
              sorrows. <seg rend="subscript">54</seg> Ah me, the pitiful one! Ah me, the mother, so
            sad it is, of the very best. [55] I gave birth to a faultless and strong son, <seg
              rend="subscript">56</seg> the very best of heroes. And he shot up [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">anedramen</foreign>] equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>]
            to a seedling [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ernos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
            >57</seg> I nurtured him like a shoot in the choicest spot of the orchard, <seg
              rend="subscript">58</seg> only to send him off on curved ships to Troy, to fight
            Trojan men. <seg rend="subscript">59</seg> And I will never be welcoming him [60] back
            home as returning warrior, back to the House of Peleus. <seg rend="subscript"
            >61</seg> And as long as he lives and sees the light of the sun, <seg rend="subscript"
              >62</seg> he will have sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akh-nutai</foreign>], and
            though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go, that I may see my dear son
            and learn what sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] has befallen him
            though he is still holding aloof from battle.”</p>
          <p>[65] She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping after, and the
            waves opened a path before them. When they reached the fertile plain of Troy, they came
            up out of the sea in a long line on to the sands, at the place where the ships of the
            Myrmidons were drawn up in close order round the tents of fleet Achilles. [70] His
            mother went up to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spoke
            piteously, saying, “My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me.
            [75] Surely Zeus has granted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands
            and besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and rue
            it bitterly that you were no longer with them.” </p>
          <p>Fleet Achilles groaned and answered, “Mother, Olympian Zeus has indeed granted me the
            fulfillment of my prayer, but what good is it to me, seeing that my dear comrade
            Patroklos has fallen—  [50] But what pleasure is there for me in these things? For
              my <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phílos</foreign> companion [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hetairos</foreign>] has perished, <seg rend="subscript">51</seg> Patroklos, to whom I
            gave more <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign> than to all the other <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>. I have lost him; yes, and Hector when he had
            killed him stripped the wondrous armor, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to
            Peleus [85] when they laid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still
            dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal
            bride. For now you shall have grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>]
            infinite by reason of the death of that son [90] whom you can never welcome home—I tell
            you, I will not live nor go about among humankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and
            thus pay me for having slain Patroklos, son of Menoitios.” </p>
          <p>Thetis wept and answered, [95] “Then, my son, is your end near at hand—for your own
            death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.” </p>
          <p>Then said Achilles in his great grief, <seg rend="subscript">98</seg> “Right away may I
            die next, since it turns out that I did not help my comrade [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hetairos</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">99</seg> by protecting him when he was
            about to be killed. And there he was, far away from his fatherland, <seg
              rend="subscript">100</seg> and he died. He missed having me as his protector from
              harm. <seg rend="subscript">101</seg> And now, since I will not have a homecoming
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">neesthai</foreign>] to my dear fatherland, <seg
              rend="subscript">102</seg> and I did not become the Light [of salvation] for Patroklos
            or for my other <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>  <seg rend="subscript"
              >103</seg> those others, many of them, who were also dispatched by radiant
              Hector  <seg rend="subscript">104</seg> —and here I am by the ships, just sitting
            here, a heavy load for Earth to bear— [105] I, who in fight have no peer among the
            Achaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife both from
            among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his heart—which
            rises up in the spirit of a man like smoke, [110] and the taste thereof is sweeter than
            drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet—so be it, for it is over; I
            will force my spirit into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will pursue Hector
            [115] who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then abide my doom when it may
            please Zeus and the other gods to send it. Even Hēraklēs, the best beloved of Zeus—even
            he could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Hera’s fierce anger laid him low,
            [120] as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. <seg rend="subscript"
              >121</seg> but now let me win worthy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>], and
            will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both their
            hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall they know that he who has
            held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer. [125] Hold me not back, therefore, in the
            love you bear me, for you shall not move me.” </p>
          <p>Then silver-footed Thetis answered, “My son, what you have said is true. It is well to
            save your comrades from destruction, [130] but your armor is in the hands of the
            Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his
            vaunt shall not be lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the
            press of battle [135] till you see me return here; tomorrow at break of day I shall be
            here, and will bring you goodly armor from King Hephaistos.” </p>
          <p>Then she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to the sea-nymphs her
            sisters, [140] “Dive into the bosom of the sea and go to the house of the old sea-god my
            father. Tell him everything; as for me, I will go to the cunning workman Hephaistos on
            high Olympus, and ask him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armor.”</p>
          <p>[145] When she had so said, they dived right then and there beneath the waves, while
            silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armor for her son. </p>
          <p>Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile the strong-greaved
            Achaeans were fleeing with loud cries before manslaughtering Hector [150] till they
            reached the ships and the Hellespont, <seg rend="subscript">151</seg> nor could they,
            well-greaved Achaeans though they were, <seg rend="subscript">152</seg> save from the
            missiles the corpse, the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign> of Achilles, for
            Hector son of Priam with his army and horsemen had again caught up to him like the flame
            of a fiery furnace; [155] three times did brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving
            with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and three times
            did the two Ajaxes, clothed in valor as with a garment, beat him from off the body;
            [160] but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of the fight, and now again
            he would stand still and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As upland shepherds
            that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcass, even so could not the two Ajaxes
            scare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroklos.</p>
          <p>[165] And now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable glory, had
            not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger from Olympus to the son of
            Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly without the knowledge of Zeus and of the
            other gods, for Hera sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, [170] “Up,
            son of Peleus, mightiest of all humankind; rescue Patroklos about whom this fearful
            fight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the Danaans in defense of
            the dead body, while the Trojans are trying to haul it away, [175] and take it to windy
            Ilion: Hector is the most furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body
            and fixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from
            the thought that Patroklos may become meat for the dogs of Troy. [180] Shame on you,
            should his body suffer any kind of outrage.” </p>
          <p>And fleet Achilles said, “Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?” </p>
          <p>Wind-footed Iris answered, “It was Hera the royal spouse of Zeus, [185] but the son of
            Kronos does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the immortals who dwell on
            the snowy summits of Olympus.”</p>
          <p>Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, “How can I go up into the battle? They have my
            armor. My mother forbade me to arm [190] till I should see her come, for she promised to
            bring me goodly armor from Hephaistos; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only
            the shield of Ajax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank
            [195] and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroklos.”</p>
          <p>Wind-footed Iris said, ‘We know that your armor has been taken, but go as you are; go
            to the deep trench and show yourself before the Trojans, that they may fear you [200]
            and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of the Achaeans gain some brief
            breathing-time, which in battle may hardly be.” Swift-footed Iris left him when she had
            so spoken. </p>
          <p>But Achilles dear to Zeus arose, and Athena flung her tasseled aegis round his strong
            shoulders; [205] she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled
            a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into the heavens from some city that
            is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea—all day long do men sally from the city
            and fight their hardest, [210] and at the going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires
            blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they
            may come with their ships and help them—even so did the light flare from the head of
            Achilles, [215] as he stood by the trench, going beyond the wall—but he did not join the
            Achaeans for he heeded the charge which his mother laid upon him. </p>
          <p>There did he stand and shout aloud. Athena also raised her voice from afar, and spread
            terror unspeakable among the Trojans. [220] Ringing as the note of a trumpet that sounds
            alarm when the foe is at the gates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the
            descendant of Aiakos, and when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed;
            the horses turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, [225] and their
            drivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the owl-vision goddess had kindled
            above the head of the great son of Peleus. </p>
          <p>Thrice did radiant Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, and three
            times were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion; [230] whereon
            twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels of their chariots and perished
            by their own spears. The Achaeans to their great joy then drew Patroklos out of reach of
            the weapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, [235] and
            among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon
            his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his return he
            was not to welcome.</p>
          <p>[240] Then ox-vision Hera sent the busy sun, loath though he was, into the waters of
            Okeanos; so he set, and the radiant Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil of
            war. </p>
          <p>Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, [245] unyoked their horses and
            gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They kept their feet, nor would any
            dare to sit down, for fear had fallen upon them all because Achilles had shown himself
            after having held aloof so long from battle. Careful Polydamas son of Panthoös was first
            to speak, a man of judgment, [250] who alone among them could look both before and
            after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the same night; with all
            sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus- </p>
          <p>“Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you [255]to go back now to your city and not
            wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from our walls. So long as this man
            has anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] against great Agamemnon, the
            Achaeans were easier to deal with, [260] and I would have gladly camped by the ships in
            the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so
            daring that he will never bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight
            with equal valor, but he will try to storm our city and carry off our women. [265] Do
            then as I say, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of night
            will for a time stay the swift-footed son of Peleus, but if he find us here in the
            morning when he sallies forth in full armor, we shall have knowledge of him in good
            earnest. [270] Glad indeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilion, and many a
            Trojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I
            say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during the night,
            [275] and the great gates with the doors that close them will protect the city. At dawn
            we can arm and take our stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the
            ships to fight us. [280] He will go back when he has given his horses their fill of
            being driven in every which direction under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and
            force his way into the city. Neither will he ever ransack it, dogs shall devour him
            before he do so.” </p>
          <p>Hector of the shining helmet looked fiercely at him and answered, [285] “Polydamas,
            your words are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the city.
            Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In the old-days the city of
            Priam was famous the whole world over for its wealth of gold and bronze, [290] but our
            treasures are wasted out of our houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia
            and fair Maeonia, for the hand of Zeus has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,
            that the son of scheming Kronos has granted me to win glory here and to hem the Achaeans
            in at their ships, prate no more in this foolish way among the population [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>]. [295] You will have no man with you; it shall not
            be; do all of you as I now say;—take your suppers in your companies throughout the army,
            and keep your watches and be wakeful every man of you. [300] If any Trojan is uneasy
            about his possessions, let him gather them and give them out among the people. Better
            let these, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about
            the ships; [305] granted that radiant Achilles has again come forward to defend them,
            let it be as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but will
            fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and the
            slayer may yet be slain.”</p>
          <p>[310] Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in approval,
            for Pallas Athena had robbed them of their understanding. They gave ear to Hector with
            his evil counsel, but the wise words of Polydamas no man would heed. They took their
            supper throughout the army, [315] and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans
            mourned Patroklos, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his
            manslaughtering hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again and again as a
            bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense
            forest; [320] when the lion comes back he is furious, and searches dingle and dell to
            track the hunter if he can find him, for he is mad with rage—even so with many a sigh
            did Achilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, “Alas! vain were the words [325] with
            which I cheered the hero Menoitios in his own house; I said that I would bring his brave
            son back again to Opoeis after he had ransacked Ilion and taken his share of the
            spoils—but Zeus does not give all men their heart’s desire. [330] The same soil shall be
            reddened here at Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home by
            the old charioteer Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this place shall the
            earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroklos, now that I am left behind you, I will not
            bury you, till I have brought here [335] the head and armor of mighty Hector who has
            slain you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you;
            till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, [340] and fair women of Troy
            and Dardanos, whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we ransacked men’s
            goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.” </p>
          <p>Then radiant Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire [345] that they
            might wash the clotted gore from off Patroklos. Then they set a tripod full of bath
            water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water
            became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in the
            cauldron was boiling [350] they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its
            wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and
            covered it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair white
            robe. Thus all night long did [355] the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn
            Patroklos. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">356</seg> And Zeus summoned Hera his sister, his wife: “So, Lady
            ox-vision Hera, you have gained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would
            think that the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.”</p>
          <p>[360] And Hera answered, “Dread son of Kronos, why should you say this thing? May not a
              man <seg rend="subscript">363</seg> who is mortal and who does not know so many
            devices [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēdea</foreign>] [as I do], do what he can for another
            person? And shall not I— [365] foremost of all goddesses both by descent and as wife to
            you who reign in the heavens—devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Hephaistos, [370]
            imperishable [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aphthitos</foreign>], star-bespangled, fairest of
            the abodes in the heavens, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god’s own hands. She
            found him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty
            tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, [375] and he set wheels of gold
            under them all that they might go of their own selves to the assemblies [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of the gods, and come back again—marvels indeed to
            see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet remained to be
            fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. [380] While
            he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Kharis, of graceful
            head-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and
            took her hand in her own, saying, [385]”Why have you come to our house, Thetis of the
            light robes, honored and ever welcome—for you do not visit us often? Come inside and let
            me set refreshment before you.” </p>
          <p>The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly decorated seat
            inlaid with silver; [390] there was a footstool also under her feet. Then she called
            Hephaistos and said, “Hephaistos, come here, Thetis wants you”; and the far-famed lame
            god answered, “Then it is indeed an august and honored goddess who has come here; [395]
            she it was that took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had
            through my cruel mother’s anger—for she would have got rid of me because I was lame. It
            would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters
            of Okeanos, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom. [400] Nine years did I stay with them,
            and many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I
            make for them in their cave, with the roaring waters of Okeanos foaming as they rushed
            ever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, [405] save only Thetis and
            Eurynome who took care of me. If, then, lovely-haired Thetis has come to my house I must
            make her due requital for having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with all
            hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools.”</p>
          <p>[410] Then the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs plying lustily
            under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and gathered his tools into a silver
            chest. Then he took a sponge and washed his face and hands, [415] his shaggy chest and
            brawny neck; he donned his khiton, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the
            door. There were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real young
            women, with sense and reason [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], voice also and
            strength, [420] and all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as the
            king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and took
            her hand in his own, saying, “Why have you come to our house, [425] Thetis honored and
            ever welcome—for you do not visit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you
            at once if I can, and if it can be done at all.” </p>
          <p>Thetis wept and answered, “Hephaistos, is there another goddess in Olympus [430] whom
            the son of Kronos has been pleased to try with so much affliction as he has me? Me alone
            of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aiakos,
            and sorely against my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, [435]
            and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven granted me a
              son, <seg rend="subscript">437</seg> the very best of heroes. And he shot up [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">anedramen</foreign>] equal [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">īsos</foreign>]
            to a seedling [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ernos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
              >438</seg> I nurtured him like a shoot in the choicest spot of the orchard, <seg
              rend="subscript">439</seg> only to send him off on curved ships to Troy, to fight
            Trojan men. [440] And I will never be welcoming him <seg rend="subscript">441</seg> back
            home as returning warrior, back to the House of Peleus. <seg rend="subscript"
            >442</seg> And as long as he lives and sees the light of the sun, <seg rend="subscript"
              >443</seg> he will have sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akh-nutai</foreign>], and
            though I go to him I cannot help him. The maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had
            awarded him, [445] powerful King Agamemnon has made him give her up, and he wastes with
            sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed
            the Achaeans in at their ships’ sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders,
            therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him great treasure, [450]
            whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, but put his own armor on
            Patroklos and sent him into the fight with many people after him. All day long they
            fought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, [455] had not
            Apollo granted glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoitios after he had done
            the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may be
            pleased to provide my son, whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with
            goodly greaves fitted with ankle-clasps, [460] and with a breastplate, for he lost his
            own when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies stretched on
            earth in the bitterness of his spirit.” </p>
          <p>And Hephaistos answered, “Take heart, and be no more disquieted about this matter;
            [465] would that I could hide him from death’s sight when his hour is come, so surely as
            I can find him armor that shall amaze the eyes of all who behold it.” </p>
          <p>When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them towards the fire
            and bidding them do their office. [470] Twenty bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and
            they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce to help him when he had need of them, and
            others less strong as Hephaistos willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough
            copper into the fire, and tin, [475] with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its
            block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the
            other. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">478</seg> First of all he was making the Shield, huge and
              massive, <seg rend="subscript">479</seg> fashioning it from inside out in every
            direction, and around it he was putting a rim that is radiant, [480] having three folds
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">triplax</foreign>] and radiant. And he [made] a silver sling
            that was hanging from it. He made the shield in five thicknesses. <seg rend="subscript"
              >482</seg> And he was making many variegated things with his knowledgeable
              thinking. <seg rend="subscript">482</seg> In it he fashioned the earth, in it the sky,
            in it the sea, <seg rend="subscript">482</seg> and the sun that does not wear out, and
            the moon in her fullness, [485] and in it he [fashioned] all the celestial signs —the
            Pleiades, the Hyades, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men also call the Wagon and which
            turns round ever in one place, facing Orion; <seg rend="subscript">489</seg> she alone
            has no share in the baths of Okeanos. </p>
          <p>[490] On it he [= the divine smith Hephaistos] wrought two cities of mortal men. <seg
              rend="subscript">491</seg> And there were weddings in one, and feasts. <seg
              rend="subscript">492</seg> They were leading the brides along the city from their
            maiden chambers <seg rend="subscript">493</seg> under the flaring of torches, and the
            loud bride song was arising. <seg rend="subscript">494</seg> The young men were dancing
            in circles, and among them [495] the pipes and the lyres kept up their clamor as in the
            meantime the women, <seg rend="subscript">496</seg> standing each at the door of the
            courtyard, admired them. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">497</seg> Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, and
            there a quarrel [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">neikos</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
              >498</seg> had arisen, and two men were quarreling [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >neikeîn</foreign>] about the blood-price [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >poinē</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">499</seg> for a man who had died. One of the
            two claimed that he had the right to pay off the damages in full, [500] declaring this
            publicly to the population of the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>],
            and the other of the two was refusing to accept anything. <seg rend="subscript"
              >501</seg> Both of them were seeking a limit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >peirar</foreign>], in the presence of an arbitrator [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >histōr</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">502</seg> and the people took sides, each
            man shouting for the side he was on; <seg rend="subscript">503</seg> but the heralds
            kept them back, and the elders <seg rend="subscript">504</seg>sat on benches of polished
            stone in a sacred [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hieros</foreign>] circle, [505] taking hold
            of scepters [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">skēptra</foreign>] that the heralds, who lift
            their voices, put into their hands. <seg rend="subscript">506</seg> Holding these
            [scepters] they rose and each in his turn gave judgment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dikazein</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">507</seg> and in their midst there were
            placed on the ground two measures of gold, <seg rend="subscript">508</seg> to be given
            to that one among them who spoke a judgment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>] in
            the most straight way [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ithuntata</foreign>].</p>
          <p>About the other city there lay encamped two armies in gleaming armor, [510] and they
            were divided whether to ransack it, or to spare it and accept the half of what it
            contained. But the men of the city would not yet consent, and armed themselves for a
            surprise; their wives and little children kept guard upon the walls, [515] and with them
            were the men who were past fighting through age;  <seg rend="subscript">516</seg> And
            they [= warriors represented on the Shield] were on their way. Leading them were Arēs
            and Pallas Athena. <seg rend="subscript">517</seg> They were both golden. And they were
            wearing golden clothing. <seg rend="subscript">518</seg> Beautiful and immense they were
            in their armor, gods that they are, <seg rend="subscript">519</seg> most visible
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">arizēlō</foreign>], side by side. But the warriors were
            smaller in size. [520] When they reached the place where they would lay their ambush, it
            was on a riverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and near to
            water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armor. Some way off them there were
            two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle, [525] which
            presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not
            so much as a thought of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut off the
            flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. [530] Meanwhile the besiegers, when they
            heard much noise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, and
            made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set battle in array by the
            banks of the river, and the armies aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. With
            them were Strife and Riot, [535] and fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one
            with a fresh wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was
            dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men’s blood. [540] They
            went in and out with one another and fought as though they were living people haling
            away one another’s dead. </p>
          <p>He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already. Many men were
            working at the plough within it, turning their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow.
            Each time that they turned on reaching the headland [545] a man would come up to them
            and give them a cup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forward to
            the time when they should again reach the headland. The part that they had ploughed was
            dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it were
            being ploughed—very curious to behold. </p>
          <p>[550] He wrought also a field of harvest grain, and the reapers were reaping with sharp
            sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the ground in a straight line behind
            them, and the binders bound them in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders,
            [555] and behind them there were boys who gathered the cut grain in armfuls and kept on
            bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in silence and
            was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a
            great ox, and were busy cutting him up, [560] while the women were making a porridge of
            much white barley for the laborers’ dinner. </p>
          <p>He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines were loaded with
            grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the vines were trained on poles of silver.
            He ran a ditch of dark metal all round it, [565] and fenced it with a fence of tin;
            there was only one path to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather the
            vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in
            plaited baskets; and with them [570] there went a boy who made sweet music with his
            lyre, and sang the Linus-song with his clear boyish voice. </p>
          <p>He wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He made the cows of gold and tin, and they
            lowed [575] as they came full speed out of the yards to go and feed among the waving
            reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along with the cattle there went four
            shepherds, all of them in gold, and their nine fleet dogs went with them. [580] Two
            terrible lions had fastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and
            bellow as he might they hauled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore
            through the bull’s thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen
            were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; [585] the dogs dared not
            fasten on the lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm’s way. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">587</seg> Next, the one with the two great arms [= Hephaistos],
            whose fame is supreme, made [an image of] a space for pasturing <seg rend="subscript"
              >588</seg> in a beautiful mountainous place. It was a vast space, full of sheep with
            shining fleeces. <seg rend="subscript">589</seg> It [= this space for pasturing] had
            herdsmen’s stations [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">stathmoi</foreign>], shelters [<foreign

              xml:lang="xgrc">sēkoi</foreign>]. </p>
          <p>[590] The renowned one [= the god Hephaistos], the one with the two strong arms,
            pattern-wove [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">poikillein</foreign>] in it [= the Shield of

            >591</seg> It [= the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>] was just like the one
            that, once upon a time in far-ruling Knossos, <seg rend="subscript">592</seg> Daedalus
            made for Ariadne, the one with the beautiful tresses [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >plokamoi</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">593</seg> There were young men there, and
            girls who are courted with gifts of cattle, <seg rend="subscript">594</seg> and they all
            were dancing with each other, holding hands at the wrist. [595] The girls were wearing
            delicate dresses, while the boys were clothed in tunics [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >khitōn</foreign> plural] <seg rend="subscript">596</seg> well-woven, gleaming
            exquisitely, with a touch of olive oil. <seg rend="subscript">597</seg> The girls had
            beautiful garlands [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">stephanai</foreign>], while the boys had
              knives <seg rend="subscript">598</seg> made of gold, hanging from knife-belts made of
              silver. <seg rend="subscript">599</seg> Half the time they moved fast in a circle,
            with expert steps, [600] showing the greatest ease, as when a wheel, solidly built, is
            given a spin by the hands <seg rend="subscript">601</seg> of a seated potter, who is
            testing it whether it will run well. <seg rend="subscript">602</seg> The other half of
            the time they moved fast in straight lines, alongside each other. <seg rend="subscript"
              >603</seg> A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">khoros</foreign>] that rouses desire, <seg rend="subscript"
            >604</seg> and they were feeling delight [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >terpesthai</foreign>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >melpesthai</foreign>] a divine singer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >aoidos</foreign>], [605] playing on the special lyre [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >phorminx</foreign>]; two special dancers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kubistētēre</foreign>] among them <seg rend="subscript">606</seg> were swirling as he
            led [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">exarkhein</foreign>] the singing and dancing [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">molpē</foreign>] in their midst. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">607</seg> And he was putting in it the mighty power of the river

          <p><seg rend="subscript">609</seg> And when he had fashioned the huge and massive
            Shield,  he made a breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. [610] He made helmet,
            close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging it; and he
            made greaves also of beaten tin. </p>
          <p>Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armor, he took it and set it before
            the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a falcon from the snowy summits of
            Olympus and bore away the gleaming armor from the house of Hephaistos.</p>

        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 19</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of
            Okeanos, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with the
            armor that the god had given her. She found her son fallen about the body of Patroklos
            [5] and weeping bitterly. Many also of his followers were weeping round him, but when
            the goddess came among them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, “My son, grieve as
            we may we must let this man lie, for it is by the will of the gods that he has fallen;
            [10] now, therefore, accept from Hephaistos this rich and goodly armor, which no man has
            ever yet borne upon his shoulders.” </p>
          <p>As she spoke she set the armor before Achilles, and it rang out bravely as she did so.
            The Myrmidons were struck with awe, [15] and none dared look full at it, for they were
            afraid; but Achilles was roused to still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a
            fierce light, for he was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had
            made him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, [20] he said to
            his mother, “Mother, the god has given me armor, meet handiwork for an immortal and such
            as no living could have fashioned; I will now arm, [25] but I much fear that flies will
            settle upon the son of Menoitios and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now
            he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.” </p>
          <p>Silver-footed Thetis answered, “My son, be not disquieted about this matter. [30] I
            will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome flies that prey on the bodies
            of men who have been killed in battle. He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall
            still be as sound as ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in
            assembly; [35] unsay your anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] against
            Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might and main.” </p>
          <p>As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then dropped ambrosia
            and red nectar into the wounds of Patroklos, that his body might suffer no change.</p>
          <p>[40] Then radiant Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on
            the Achaean heroes. Then even those who as yet had stayed always at the assembly of
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of ships, those who were steersmen [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] and held the steering-oars of the ships, and
            even the stewards who were about the ships and served out rations, [45] all came to the
            place of assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long
            from fighting. Two attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs,
            radiant Odysseus and the son of Tydeus, came limping, for their wounds still pained
            them; [50] nevertheless they came, and took their seats in the front row of the
            assembly. Last of all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Koön son of
            Antenor had struck him with a spear in battle. </p>
          <p>When the Achaeans were got together [55] Achilles of the swift feet rose and said, “Son
            of Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me, when we two were
            in such high anger about Brisēis, surely it would have been better, had Artemis’ arrow
            slain her at the ships [60] on the day when I took her after having ransacked Lyrnessos.
            For so, many an Achaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my
            anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long indeed
            remember our quarrel. [65] Now, however, let it be, for it is over. If we have been
            angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever;
            therefore, bid the flowing-haired Achaeans arm right away [70] that I may go out against
            the Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad,
            I think, will he be to rest his knees who may flee my spear when I wield it.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">74</seg> Thus he spoke. And the fair-greaved Achaeans were happy
            [75] that the great-hearted son of Peleus unsaid his anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mēnis</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">76</seg> Then Agamemnon, the king of men,
            spoke up at their meeting, <seg rend="subscript">77</seg> right there from the place
            where he was sitting, not even standing up in the middle of the assembly. <seg
              rend="subscript">78</seg> “Near and dear ones,” said he, “Danaan [= Achaean] heroes,
            attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] of Arēs! <seg
              rend="subscript">79</seg> It is a good thing to listen when a man stands up to speak,
            and it is not seemly [80] to speak in relay after him. It would be hard for someone to
            do that, even if he is a practiced speaker. <seg rend="subscript">81</seg> For how could
            any man in an assembly either hear anything when there is an uproar <seg
              rend="subscript">82</seg> or say anything? Even a public speaker who speaks clearly
            will be disconcerted by it. <seg rend="subscript">83</seg> What I will do is to make a
            declaration addressed to [Achilles] the son of Peleus. As for the rest of you <seg
              rend="subscript">84</seg> Argives [= Achaeans], you should understand and know well,
            each one of you, the words [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mūthos</foreign>] that I say for
            the record. [85] By now the Achaeans have been saying these words [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mūthos</foreign>] to me many times, <seg rend="subscript">86</seg> and
            they have been blaming me. But I am not responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aitios</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">87</seg> No, those who are really
            responsible are Zeus and Fate [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Moira</foreign>] and the Fury
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Erinys</foreign>] who roams in the mist. <seg
              rend="subscript">88</seg> They are the ones who, at the public assembly, had put

            myself deprived Achilles of his honorific portion [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >geras</foreign>]. [90] But what could I do? The god is the one who brings everything

              >91</seg> That goddess Atē, senior daughter of Zeus—she makes everyone veer off-course

          <p>[95] Yes, once upon a time even Zeus veered off-course [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aâsthai</foreign>], who is said to be the best <seg rend="subscript">96</seg> among
            men and gods. Even he <seg rend="subscript">97</seg> was deceived; Hērā did it, with her

            on the day when the mighty Hēraklēs <seg rend="subscript">99</seg> was about to be born
            of Alkmene in Thebes, the city garlanded by good walls. [100] He [= Zeus], making a
            formal declaration [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">eukhesthai</foreign>], spoke up at a
            meeting of all the gods and said: <seg rend="subscript">101</seg> ‘Hear me, all gods and

            shall fall to the ground between the legs of a woman <seg rend="subscript">111</seg> who
            is descended from men who come from your line of ancestry, from blood that comes from

          <p>And Zeus did not at all notice [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>] her devious

            and there, he veered off-course [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aâsthai</foreign>] in a big

            >119</seg> Meanwhile she put a pause on the time of delivery for Alkmene, holding back
            the divine powers of labor, the Eileithuiai. [120] And then she herself went to tell the
            news to Zeus the son of Kronos, saying: <seg rend="subscript">121</seg> ‘Zeus the
            father, you with the gleaming thunderbolt, I will put a word into your thoughts: <seg
              rend="subscript">122</seg> there has just been born a man, a noble one, who will be
            king over the Argives. <seg rend="subscript">123</seg> He is Eurystheus son of Sthenelos
            son of Perseus. <seg rend="subscript">124</seg> He is from your line of ancestry, and it
            is not unseemly for him to be king over the Argives.’</p>
          <p>[125] So she spoke, and he was struck in his mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >phrēn</foreign>] with a sharp sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>]. <seg
              rend="subscript">126</seg> And right away he grabbed the goddess Atē by the head—that
            head covered with luxuriant curls— <seg rend="subscript">127</seg> since he was angry in
            his thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phrenes</foreign>], and he swore a binding
              oath <seg rend="subscript">128</seg> that never will she come to Olympus and to the
            starry sky <seg rend="subscript">129</seg> never again will she come back, that goddess
            Atē, who makes everyone veer off-course [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aâsthai</foreign>].
            [130] And so saying he threw her down from the starry sky, <seg rend="subscript"
              >131</seg> having whirled her around in his hand. And then she [= Atē] came to the
            fields where mortals live and work. <seg rend="subscript">132</seg>He [= Zeus] always
            mourned the fact that she ever existed, every time he saw how his own dear son <seg
              rend="subscript">133</seg> was having one of his degrading Labors [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">āthloi</foreign>] to work on. <seg rend="subscript">134</seg> So also
            I [= Agamemnon], while the great Hector, the one with the gleaming helmet, [135] was
            destroying the Argives [= Achaeans] at the sterns of the beached ships, <seg
              rend="subscript">136</seg> was not able to keep out of my mind the veering [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] I experienced once I veered off-course [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aâsthai</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">137</seg> But since I did
            veer off-course [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aâsthai</foreign>] and since Zeus took away
            from me my thinking, <seg rend="subscript">138</seg> I now want to make amends, and to
            give untold amounts of compensation. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people
            with you. [140] I will give you all that radiant Odysseus offered you yesterday in your
            tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at once, and my
            attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] shall bring the gifts from
            my ship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough.”</p>
          <p>[145] And Achilles answered, “Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can give such
            gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in your own hands. Let us now
            set battle in array; it is not well to tarry talking about trifles, [150] for there is a
            deed which is as yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,
            and laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he is
            fighting.” </p>
          <p>Then resourceful Odysseus said, [155] “Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the
            Achaeans thus against Ilion to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be no
            brief one, when it is once begun, and the gods have filled both sides with fury; [160]
            bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships, for in this there is strength
            and stay. No man can do battle the livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is
            without food; however much he may want to fight [165] his strength will fail him before
            he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow weary under
            him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats
            high, and his strength will stay [170] till he has routed all his foes; therefore, send
            the people away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts
            in presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied. [175]
            Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never gone up into the
            couch of Brisēis, nor has lain down with her, even though it is right [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] for humans, both men and women, to do this; and do
            you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind; <seg rend="subscript">179</seg> But let him
            [Agamemnon] make amends to you with a rich feast [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dais</foreign>] in the tents, [180] so that you may have no lack in <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">dikē</foreign>. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more
            righteously in future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he
            was wrong in the first instance.” </p>
          <p>And King Agamemnon answered, [185] “Son of Laertes, your words please me well, for
            throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would have me do; I do so of my
            own free will, neither shall I take the name of a superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would
            fain fight at once, [190] and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent
            and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you: choose [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">krinein</foreign>] some noble young Achaeans to go with you, and bring
            from my tents the gifts [195] that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women
            also; furthermore let Talthybios find me a boar from those that are with the army, and
            make it ready for sacrifice to Zeus and to the sun.” </p>
          <p>Then said Achilles, “Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men Agamemnon, [200] see to
            these matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I am calmer.
            Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector son of Priam slew are still
            lying mangled upon the plain? [205] Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting
            and without food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let
            them eat their fill. As for me, [210] Patroklos is lying dead in my tent, all hacked and
            hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I
            can take thought of nothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat
            of the dying.”</p>
          <p>[215] Odysseus answered, “Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans, in
            battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, but in counsel I am much
            before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge. [220] Therefore be patient under my
            words. Fighting is a thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Zeus, who is war’s
            steward, weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have
            reaped is far heavier than the grain. [225] It may not be that the Achaeans should mourn
            the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold continually; when
            should we have respite from our sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>]? Let
            us mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, [230] but let those of
            us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that
            hour let no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; [235] such summons shall bode
            ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and
            loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>When he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of glorious Nestor, with Meges son of
            Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lykomedes [240] son of Kreontes, and Melanippos, and went to
            the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word was not sooner said than the deed was
            done: they brought out the seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty
            metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; [245] And they led forth right away the women,
            skilled in flawless handiwork, <seg rend="subscript">246</seg> seven of them, and the
            eighth was Brisēis of the fair cheeks. Odysseus weighed out the ten talents of gold and
            then led the way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid
            them in the middle of the assembly. </p>
          <p>Agamemnon [250] then rose, and Talthybios whose voice was like that of a god came to
            him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he wore by the scabbard of his
            mighty sword, and began by cutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands
            [255] in prayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and
            orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of the heavens and prayed
            saying, “I call Zeus the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I call also Earth
            and Sun and the Furies [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Erinyes</foreign>] who dwell below
            [260] and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon
            the girl Brisēis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that she has remained
            in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may the gods visit me [265] with all the
            penalties which they mete out to those who perjure themselves.” </p>
          <p>He cut the boar’s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybios whirled it round his head, and
            flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the
            battle-fond Argives, [270] “Father Zeus, truly you give derangement [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] to men and damage them. The son of Atreus had not else
            stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Brisēis from me against my
            will. Surely Zeus must have counseled the destruction of many an Argive. [275] Go, now,
            and take your food that we may begin fighting.” </p>
          <p>Then he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own ship. The Myrmidons
            attended to the presents and took them away to the ship of godlike Achilles. [280] They
            placed them in his tents, while the attendants [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapontes</foreign>] drove the horses in among the others. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">282</seg> Then Brisēis, looking like golden Aphrodite, <seg
              rend="subscript">283</seg> saw Patroklos all cut apart by the sharp bronze, and, when
            she saw him, <seg rend="subscript">284</seg> she poured herself all over him in tears
            and wailed with a voice most clear, and with her hands she tore at [285] her breasts and
            her tender neck and her beautiful face. <seg rend="subscript">286</seg> And then she
            spoke, weeping, this woman who looked like the goddesses: <seg rend="subscript"
              >287</seg> “O Patroklos, you have been most gracious to me in my terrible state and
            most gratifying to my heart. <seg rend="subscript">288</seg> You were alive when I last
            saw you on my way out from the shelter <seg rend="subscript">289</seg> —and now I come
            back to find you dead, you, the protector of your people [290] —that is what I come back
            to find. Oh, how I have one misfortune after the next to welcome me. <seg
              rend="subscript">291</seg> The man to whom I was given away by my father and by my
            mother the queen <seg rend="subscript">292</seg> —I saw that man lying there in front of
            the city, all cut apart by the sharp bronze, <seg rend="subscript">293</seg> and lying
            near him were my three brothers— all of us were born of one mother— <seg
              rend="subscript">294</seg> they are all a cause for my sorrow, since they have all met
            up with their time of destruction. [295] No, you [= Patroklos] did not let me—back when
            my husband was killed by swift-footed Achilles, <seg rend="subscript">296</seg> killed
            by him, and when the city of my godlike Mynes [= my husband] was destroyed by him <seg
              rend="subscript">297</seg> —you did not let me weep, back then, but you told me that
            godlike Achilles <seg rend="subscript">298</seg> would have me as a properly courted
            wife, that you would make that happen, and that you would take me on board the
              ships, <seg rend="subscript">299</seg> taking me all the way to Phthia, and that you
            would arrange for a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. [300] So now I cannot stop crying
            for you, now that you are dead, you who were always so sweet and gentle.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">301</seg> So she [= Brisēis] spoke, weeping, and the women kept
            on mourning in response. <seg rend="subscript">302</seg> They mourned for Patroklos,
            that was their pretext, but they were all mourning, each and every one of them, for what
            they really cared for in their sorrow. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round
            Achilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. [305] “I pray
            you,” said he, “if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat nor drink, for I am in
            great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to the going down of the sun.” </p>
          <p>Then he sent the other princes away, [310] save only the two sons of Atreus and radiant
            Odysseus, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the old charioteer Phoenix, who stayed behind and tried
            to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>]: <seg rend="subscript">312</seg> nor was he gladdened in
              his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign> <seg rend="subscript">313</seg> until he
            entered the jaws of bloody war, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of Patroklos.
            Then he said,</p>
          <p>[315] “Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner ready for me
            at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hastening to fight the Trojans. <seg
              rend="subscript">319</seg> But now there you are, lying there, all cut up, while my
            heart [320] is wanting, though I have drink and food [in my shelter], <seg
              rend="subscript">321</seg> because of my longing [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pothē</foreign>] for you. There is nothing I could possibly suffer that would be
            worse than this, <seg rend="subscript">322</seg> not even if I were to hear news that my
            father died <seg rend="subscript">323</seg> —who is now in Phthia weeping gently <seg
              rend="subscript">324</seg> about losing the kind of son that he has, and here I am,
            this son that I am, in a foreign country [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>],
            [325] and I am waging war here for the sake of that dreadful Helen <seg rend="subscript"
              >326</seg> —or if I heard news that my dear son died, the one who is being brought up
            in Skyros— <seg rend="subscript">327</seg> if in fact godlike Neoptolemos is still
            living. Till now I was sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, [330]
            while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own ship, and
            show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house—for Peleus must
            surely be either [335] dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with
            the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my
            death.” </p>
          <p>He wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought on what he had
            left at home behind him. [340] The son of Kronos looked down with pity upon them, and
            said presently to Athena, “My child, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone
            so clean out of your recollection? There [345] he sits by the ships all desolate for the
            loss of his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he will neither
            eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no
            hunger.” </p>
          <p>With these words he urged Athena, who was already of the same mind. [350] She darted
            down from the heavens into the air like some falcon sailing on his broad wings and
            screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming throughout the army, and when Athena had
            dropped nectar and ambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs
            to fail him, [355] she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the chill
            snow-flakes shed from the hand of Zeus and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind,
            even so thick did the gleaming helmets, [360] the bossed shields, the strongly plated
            breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the
            whole land was radiant with their flashing armor, and the sound of the tramp of their
            treading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all radiant Achilles put on
            his armor; [365] he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire, for his grief
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] was greater than he could bear. Thus, then,
            full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armor that
            Hephaistos had made him. <seg rend="subscript">368</seg> He [= Achilles] put it [= his
            armor] on, the gifts of the god, which Hephaistos had made for him with much labor. </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">369</seg> First he put around his legs the shin guards, [370]
            beautiful ones, with silver fastenings at the ankles. <seg rend="subscript"
            >371</seg> Next he put around his chest the breastplate, <seg rend="subscript"
            >372</seg> and around his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver, <seg
              rend="subscript">373</seg> a sword made of bronze. Next, the Shield [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">sakos</foreign>], great and mighty, <seg rend="subscript">374</seg> he
            took on, and from it there was a gleam [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">selas</foreign>] from
            afar, as from the moon, [375] or as when, from the sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>], a gleam [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">selas</foreign>] to sailors
            appears [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phainesthai</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript"
            >376</seg> from a blazing fire, the kind that blazes high in the mountains <seg
              rend="subscript">377</seg> at a solitary [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">oiopolos</foreign>]
            station [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">stathmos</foreign>], as the sailors are carried
            unwilling by gusts of wind <seg rend="subscript">378</seg> over the fish-swarming sea
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], far away from their loved ones [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">philoi</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">379</seg> —so also did the
            gleam [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">selas</foreign>] emanating from the Shield [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">sakos</foreign>] of Achilles reach all the way up to the aether. [380]
            He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a
            star, and the golden plumes which Hephaistos had set thick about the ridge of the
            helmet, waved all around it. Then radiant Achilles made trial of himself in his armor
            [385] to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it
            seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings. </p>
          <p>He also drew his father’s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so great and heavy and
            strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles had strength to wield it; [390] the
            Pelian ash-spear, which Cheiron had given to his <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >philos</foreign> father, <seg rend="subscript">391</seg> from the heights of Mount
            Pelion, to be death for heroes. Automedon and Alkimos busied themselves with the
            harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about them, and put the bit in their
            mouths, drawing the reins back [395] towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand,
            sprang up behind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armor, resplendent
            as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his father’s horses
            saying, [400] “Xanthos and Balios, famed offspring of Podarge—this time when we have
            done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely back to the army of the Achaeans, and
            do not leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroklos.” </p>
          <p>Then fleet Xanthos answered under the yoke— [405] for white-armed Hera had endowed him
            with human speech—and he bowed his head till his mane touched the ground as it hung down
            from under the yoke-band. “Dread Achilles,” said he, “we will indeed save you now, but
            the day of your death is near, and we will not be responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aitioi</foreign>], [410] for it will be the gods and stern fate that will destroy
            you. Neither was it through any sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped
            Patroklos of his armor; it was the mighty god whom lovely-haired Leto bore that slew him
            as he fought among the foremost, and granted a triumph to Hector. [415] We two can fly
            as swiftly as Zephyros who they say is fleetest of all winds; nevertheless it is your
            doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.” </p>
          <p>When he had thus spoken, the Furies [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">Erinyes</foreign>]
            blocked his speaking any further, and fleet Achilles answered him in great sadness,
            saying, [420] “Why, O Xanthos, do you thus foretell my death? You need not do so, for I
            well know that I am to fall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more,
            however, shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of
            fighting.” </p>
          <p>So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 20</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son
            of Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against them armed upon
            the rise of the plain. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile Zeus from the top of Olympus with its many valleys, bade Themis gather the
            gods in council, [5] whereon she went about and called them to the house of Zeus. There
            was not a river absent except Okeanos, nor a single one of the nymphs that haunt fair
            groves, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. [10] When they reached the
            house of cloud-compelling Zeus, they took their seats in the arcades of polished marble
            which Hephaistos with his consummate skill had made for father Zeus. </p>
          <p>In such a way, therefore, did they gather in the house of Zeus. Poseidon also, lord of
            the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came up out of the sea to join them.
            [15] There, sitting in the midst of them, he asked what Zeus’ purpose might be. “Why,”
            said he, “wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you
            considering some matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans—for the blaze of battle
            is on the point of being kindled between them?” </p>
          <p>And Zeus answered, [20] “You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore I have
            called you here. I take thought for them even in their destruction. For my own part I
            shall stay here seated on Mount Olympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about
            among Trojans and Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed in
            your thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. [25] If Achilles fights the
            Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against him; they have ever trembled
            at the sight of him, and now that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, [30] he
            will override fate itself and storm their city.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke Zeus and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their several sides
            and went into battle. Hera, Pallas Athena, earth-encircling Poseidon, Hermes bringer of
            good luck and excellent in all cunning— [35] all these joined the army that came from
            the assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of ships; with them also came
            Hephaistos in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs plying lustily under
            him. Arēs of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn,
            and the archer goddess Artemis, [40] Leto, Xanthos, and laughter-loving Aphrodite. </p>
          <p>So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the Achaeans were
            triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight was now with them. There was not
            a Trojan but his limbs failed him for fear [45] as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all
            glorious in his armor, and looking like Arēs himself. When, however, the Olympians came
            to take their part among men, right then and there arose strong Strife, rouser of
            armies, and Athena raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran
            outside the wall, [50] and now shouting with all her might upon the shore of the
            sounding sea. Arēs also bellowed out upon the other side, dark as some black
            thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the
            acropolis, and now speeding up the side of the river Simoeis till he came to the hill
            Kallikolone. </p>
          <p>Thus did the gods spur on both armies [55] to fight, and rouse fierce contention also
            among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered from the heavens above, while from
            beneath Poseidon shook the vast earth, and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and
            crests of many-fountained Ida quaked, [60] as also the city of the Trojans and the ships
            of the Achaeans. Hādēs, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang
            panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Poseidon, lord of the
            earthquake, should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his moldy mansions to
            the sight of mortals and immortals— [65] mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods
            shudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.
            Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Poseidon, while owl-vision Athena
            took hers against the god of war; [70] the archer-goddess Artemis with her golden
            arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Hera; generous Hermes the lusty
            bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men call
            Skamandros, but gods Xanthos, matched himself against Hephaistos.</p>
          <p>[75] The gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of Achilles
            was set on meeting Hector, son of Priam, for it was with his blood that he longed above
            all things else to glut the stubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to
            attack [80] the son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice
            of Lykaon, son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, “Aeneas,
            counselor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you vaunted over your
            wine before the Trojan princes, [85] saying that you would fight Achilles, son of
            Peleus, in single combat?” </p>
          <p>And Aeneas answered, “Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of Peleus, when I am
            in no mind to do so? [90] Were I to face him now, it would not be for the first time.
            His spear has already put me to flight from Ida, when he attacked our cattle and
            ransacked Lyrnessos and Pedasos; Zeus indeed saved me in that he granted me strength to
            flee, else I had fallen by the hands of Achilles and Athena, [95] who went before him to
            protect him and urged him to fall upon the Leleges and Trojans. No man may fight
            Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his guardian, and even were it not
            so, his weapon flies ever straight, and fails not [100] to pierce the flesh of him who
            is against him; if the gods would let me fight him to the finish [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] on even terms, he should not soon overcome me, though
            he boasts that he is made of bronze.” </p>
          <p>Then said King Apollo, son to Zeus, “Nay, hero, pray [105] to the ever-living gods, for
            men say that you were born of Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite, whereas Achilles is son to a
            goddess of inferior rank. Aphrodite is child to Zeus, while Thetis is but daughter to
            the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not
            scare you with his taunts and menaces.”</p>
          <p>[110] As he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his people, and he
            strode in full armor among the ranks of the foremost fighters. Nor did the son of
            Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Hera, as he went forth into the throng to meet
            Achilles. She called the gods about her, and said, [115] “Look to it, you two, Poseidon
            and Athena, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad
            in full armor to fight Achilles. [120] Shall we turn him back at once, or shall one of
            us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so that his heart fail not, and he may
            learn that the chiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have all
            along been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? [125] Let us all come down from
            Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the hands of the
            Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have spun out for him when he was
            begotten and his mother bore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god,
            [130] he may come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are
            terrible if they are seen face to face.” </p>
          <p>Poseidon lord of the earthquake answered her saying, “Hera, restrain your fury, which
            has made you veer in your thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]; it is not
            well; I am not in favor of forcing the other gods to fight us, [135] for the advantage
            is too greatly on our own side; let us take our places on some hill out of the beaten
            track, and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Arēs or Phoebus Apollo begin
            fighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, [140] we too, will at once
            raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon leave the field and go back
            vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.” </p>
          <p>With these words the dark-haired god led the way [145] to the high earth-mound of
            godlike Hēraklēs, built round solid masonry, and made by the Trojans and Pallas Athena
            for him to flee to when the sea-monster was chasing him from the shore onto the plain.
            Here Poseidon and those that were with him took their seats, [150] wrapped in a thick
            cloud of darkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Kallikolone round
            you, O Phoebus, and Arēs, the waster of cities. </p>
          <p>Thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was willing to begin
            battle with the other, [155] and Zeus from his seat on high was in command over them
            all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam
            of armor. The earth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each
            other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the armies to
            fight— [160] to wit, Aeneas, son of Anchises, and noble Achilles. </p>
          <p>Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet tossing defiance as he
            came on. He held his strong shield before his breast, and brandished his bronze spear.
            The son of Peleus from the other side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion
            [165] that the whole population [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] has met to
            hunt and kill—at first he bodes no ill, but when some daring youth has struck him with a
            spear, he crouches openmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, [170] he lashes his
            tail from side to side about his ribs and loins, <seg rend="subscript">171</seg> and it
            is impelling itself to fight glaring as he springs straight before him with force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>], to find out whether he is to slay, or be
            slain among the foremost of his foes— <seg rend="subscript">174</seg> so also
              the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign> and overweening <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign> of Achilles impelled him onwards [175] to spring upon great-hearted
            Aeneas.</p>
          <p>When they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to speak. <seg
              rend="subscript">178</seg> “Aeneas! Why are you standing so far up front in the
              battle? <seg rend="subscript">179</seg> Does your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign> urge you to fight against me [180] because you hope to be king of
            the horse-taming Trojans, <seg rend="subscript">181</seg> which is the <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign> of Priam? But even if you kill me, <seg
              rend="subscript">182</seg> Priam will not place the honorific portion [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">geras</foreign>] in your hand on that account. <seg rend="subscript"
              >183</seg> He has children, and he is sound and not unstable. Or have the Trojans been
            allotting you a demesne of passing richness, [185] fair with orchard lawns and wheat
            lands, if you should slay me? This you shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once
            already. Have you forgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds
            helter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? [190] You did not turn round to look behind you;
            you took refuge in Lyrnessos, but I attacked the city, and with the help of Athena and
            father Zeus I ransacked it and carried its women into captivity, though Zeus and the
            other gods rescued you. You think they will protect you now, but they will not do so;
            [195] therefore I say go back into the army, and do not face me, or you will rue it.
            Even a fool may be wise after the event.” </p>
          <p>Then Aeneas answered, [200] “Son of Peleus! Do not hope to intimidate me with words
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">epos</foreign> plural] as if I were some child. <seg
              rend="subscript">201</seg> For I myself know clearly how to tell <seg rend="subscript"
              >202</seg> reproaches [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kertomiai</foreign>] and unseemly
              things. <seg rend="subscript">203</seg> We know each other’s lineage, we know each

            never yet seen my parents, nor I yours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and
            that your mother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for
            my father, and Aphrodite for my mother; [210] the parents of one or other of us shall
            this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us when the
            fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will—and it is known to many.</p>
          <p>[215] In the beginning Dardanos was the son of Zeus, and founded Dardania, for Ilion
            was not yet established on the plain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on
            the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanos had a son, king Erikhthonios, [220] who was
            wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows,
            they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamored of them as they were feeding, and
            covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. [225] Twelve female foals did
            they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the fertile plain, would go
            bounding on over the ripe ears of wheat and not break them; or again when they would
            disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a
            breaker. [230] Erikhthonios begat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble
            sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and godlike Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore
            the gods carried him off to be Zeus’ cupbearer, [235] on account of his beauty, so that
            he might be among the Immortals. Ilos begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonos,
            Priam, Lampos, Klytios, and Hiketaon of the stock of Arēs. But Assarakos was father to
            Kapys, and Kapys to Anchises, [240] who was my father, while Hector the radiant is son
            to Priam.</p>
          <p>Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aretē</foreign>], Zeus gives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And
            now let there be no more of this prating [245] in mid-battle as though we were
              children. <seg rend="subscript">246</seg> It is possible for the two of us to tell

          <p>As he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of Achilles, which rang
            out as the point struck it. [260] The son of Peleus held the shield before him with his
            strong hand, and he was afraid, for he thought that great-hearted Aeneas’ spear would go
            through it quite easily, [265] not reflecting that the god’s glorious gifts were little
            likely to yield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed war-wise Aeneas’ spear did
            not pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point. It went
            through two layers, [270] but the god had made the shield in five, two of bronze, the
            two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it was in this that the spear was
            stayed. </p>
          <p>Achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas [275] at the very
            edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash went clean through, and the
            shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the
            shield away from him; the spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the
            ground, [280] after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas
            though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] because the weapon had gone so near him; then
            Achilles sprang furiously upon him, [285] with a cry as of death and with his keen blade
            drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men now are, would be
            unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily. </p>
          <p>Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him, either on the
            helmet, or on the shield that covered him, [290] and Achilles would have closed with him
            and dispatched him with his sword, had not Poseidon, lord of the earthquake, been quick
            to mark, and said right then and there to the immortals, “Alas, I feel grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] for great Aeneas, who will now go down to the house
            of Hādēs, [295] vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the
            counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this man
            suffer grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] when he is guiltless, to no
            purpose, and in another’s quarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice
            to the gods that dwell in the heavens? [300] Let us then snatch him from death’s jaws,
            lest the son of Kronos be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he
            should escape, and that the race of Dardanos, whom Zeus loved above all the sons born to
            him of mortal women, [305] shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. <seg
              rend="subscript">306</seg> For the son of Kronos has already abominated the line of
              Priam. <seg rend="subscript">307</seg> And presently the might [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] of Aeneas will be king of the Trojans <seg
              rend="subscript">308</seg> and his children’s children, who are to be born
            hereafter.” </p>
          <p>Then answered ox-vision Hera, [310] “Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and
            consider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him, brave though he
            be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas
            Athena, [315] have sworn full many a time before all the immortals, that never would we
            shield Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that
            the Achaeans shall kindle.” </p>
          <p>When earth-encircling Poseidon heard this he went into the battle amid the clash of
            spears, [320] and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas were. Right then and there
            he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen
            spear from the shield of Aeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. [325] Then he
            lifted Aeneas on high from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a
            band of warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god’s hand sped him, till he
            came to the very fringe of the battle where the Kaukones were arming themselves for
            fight. Poseidon, shaker of the earth, then came near to him [330] and said, “Aeneas,
            what god has egged you on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a
            mightier man of valor and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him
            whenever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hādēs even though fate would
            have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the foremost
            undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you.” </p>
          <p>[340] The god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once removed
            the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened them wide indeed and said in
            great anger, “Alas! what marvel am I now beholding? [345] Here is my spear upon the
            ground, but I see not him whom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also
            must be under heaven’s protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let him
            go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, [350] seeing how narrowly he has
            missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the Danaans and attack some other of
            the Trojans.” </p>
          <p>He sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so. “Let not the
            Trojans,” he cried, “keep you at arm’s length, Achaeans, [355] but go for them and fight
            them man for man. However valiant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all
            of them. Even Arēs, who is an immortal, or Athena, would shrink from flinging himself
            into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, [360] so far as in me
            lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even for a
            moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within
            reach of my spear.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he exhort them. Meanwhile glorious Hector called upon the Trojans [365] and
            declared that he would fight Achilles. “Be not afraid, proud Trojans,” said he, “to face
            the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the battle were one of words only, but
            they would be more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of
            Achilles will fall somewhat short of the outcome [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>] [370] of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he will
            clip short. I will go up against him though his hands be as fire—though his hands be
            fire and his strength iron.” </p>
          <p>Thus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and raised the cry
            of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of their ranks. [375] But Phoebus
            Apollo came up to Hector and said, “Hector, on no account must you challenge Achilles to
            single combat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the others and away
            from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you
            down at close quarters.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, [380] for he was afraid when he
            heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon the Trojans with a
            terrible cry, clothed in valor as with a garment. First he killed Iphition great son of
            Otrynteus, a leader of many people whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of
            cities, [385] in the district [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of Hyde under
            the snowy heights of Mount Tmolos. Great Achilles struck him full on the head as he was
            coming on towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground
            and Achilles vaunted over him saying, “You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; [390]
            your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father’s estate
            lies, by Hyllos, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermos.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The chariots of the
            Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in the front of the battle, [395]
            and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He
            struck him on the temple through his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the
            spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone [400] so that the brain inside was shed
            in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the
            midriff as he was springing down from his chariot in front of him, and trying to escape.
            He breathed his last, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to
            offer him in sacrifice to the King of Helike, [405] and the heart of the earth-shaker is
            glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went in pursuit of godlike
            Polydoros, son of Priam, whom his father had always forbidden to fight because he was
            the youngest of his sons, [410] the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in
            his folly and showing off the excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] of
            his speed, was rushing about among front ranks until he lost his life, for swift-footed
            radiant Achilles struck him in the middle of the back as he was darting past him: [415]
            he struck him just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the
            double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and came out
            by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness
            overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. </p>
          <p>When Hector saw his brother Polydoros with his entrails in his hands [420] and sinking
            down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he could not bear to keep longer at
            a distance; he therefore poised his spear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of
            fire. When Achilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, [425] “This is he
            that has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for long
            shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.” </p>
          <p>He looked fiercely on radiant Hector and said, “Draw near, that you may meet your doom
            the sooner.” [430] Hector feared him not and answered, “Son of Peleus, think not that
            your words can scare me as though I were a child; I too if I will can brag and talk
            unseemly; I know that you are a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, [435]
            nevertheless the issue lies in the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may
            not slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen before now.” </p>
          <p>He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Athena breathed upon it, [440] and though she
            breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going towards renowned Achilles, so
            that it returned to glorious Hector and lay at his feet in front of him. Achilles then
            sprang furiously on him with a loud cry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up
            easily as a god can, and hid him in a thick darkness. [445] Thrice did swift-footed
            radiant Achilles spring towards him spear in hand, and three times did he waste his blow
            upon the air. When he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a superhuman
            force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>] he shouted aloud saying, “Hound, this
            time too you have escaped death— [450] but of a truth it came exceedingly near you.
            Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved
            you; but if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you when I
            come across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and overtake other
            Trojans.”</p>
          <p>[455] Then he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck, and he fell
            headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed Demoukhos son of Philetor, a man
            both brave and of great stature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote
            him with his sword and killed him. [460] After this he sprang on Laogonos and Dardanos,
            sons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown
            spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of
            Alastor—he came up to Achilles and clasped his knees [465] in the hope that he would
            spare him and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,
            he might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood for
            pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees
            and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver, [470] and
            the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that
            welled from the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless. </p>
          <p>Achilles then went up to Moulios and struck him on the ear with a spear, and the bronze
            spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also struck Ekheklos son of Agenor on the
            head with his sword, [475] which became warm with the blood, while death and stern fate
            closed the eyes of Ekheklos. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded
            Deukalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he waited
            Achilles’ onset [480] with his arm hanging down and death staring him in the face.
            Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword and flung it helmet and all away
            from him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went in
            pursuit of Rhigmos, [485] noble son of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and
            struck him through the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he
            fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithoös, attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] to Rhigmos, in the back as he was turning his
            horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck with
            panic.</p>
          <p>[490] As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought—and the dense forest is
            in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of fire in every direction—even so
            furiously did Achilles rage, wielding his spear as though he were a superhuman force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>], and giving chase to those whom he would
            slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. [495] Or as one who yokes broad-browed oxen
            that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor—and it is soon bruised small under the
            feet of the lowing cattle— even so did the horses of great-hearted Achilles trample on
            the shields and bodies of the slain. [500] The axle underneath and the railing that ran
            round the car were bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses’ hooves, and
            from the tires of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win still further
            glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.</p>
        </div>
        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 21</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Now when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthos,
            begotten of immortal Zeus, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half he chased over the
            plain towards the city by the same way that the Achaeans had taken when fleeing
            panic-stricken [5] on the preceding day with glorious Hector in full triumph; this way
            did they flee pell-mell, and Hera sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them.
            The other half were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, [10] and fell into it
            with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they swam hither
            and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. As locusts flying to a river
            before the blast of a grass fire—the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes
            them and they huddle into the water— [15] even so was the eddying stream of Xanthos
            filled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before
            Achilles. </p>
          <p>Right then and there the heaven-descended hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it
            against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a superhuman force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>], armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as
            he hewed the Trojans down on every side. [20] Their dying groans rose hideous as the
            sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish flee scared before a
            huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven—for he is sure to eat
            all he can catch— [25] even so did the Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty
            river, and when Achilles’ arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive
            out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroklos, son of Menoitios. He drew them
            out like dazed fawns, [30] bound their hands behind them with the belts of their own
            khitons, and gave them over to his men to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into
            the river, thirsting for still further blood.</p>
          <p>[35] There he found Lykaon, son of Priam, seed of Dardanos, as he was escaping out of
            the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when he was in his father’s
            vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he was cutting young shoots from a wild
            fig-tree to make the wicker sides of a chariot. [40] Achilles then caught him to his
            sorrow unawares, and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But a
            guest-friend, Eëtion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and sent him to Arisbe,
            whence he had escaped and returned to his father’s house. [45] He had spent eleven days
            diverting his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>] with his friends after
            he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him into the hands of
            Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hādēs sorely against his will. He was
            unarmed when swift-footed Achilles caught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor
            shield; [50] nor yet had he any spear, for he had thrown all his armor from him on to
            the bank, and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his
            strength was now failing him. </p>
          <p>Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise, “What marvel do I see here? If this man
            can come back alive after having been sold over into Lemnos, [55] I shall have the
            Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the world below. Could not even the waters of
            the gray sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] imprison him, as they do many
            another whether he will or no? [60] This time let him taste my spear, that I may know
            for certain whether mother earth who can keep even a strong man down, will be able to
            hold him, or whether thence too he will return.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lykaon came up to him dazed [65] and trying hard to
            embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die. Radiant Achilles thrust at him with
            his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lykaon ran crouching up to him and caught his knees,
            whereby the spear passed over his back, [70] and stuck in the ground, hungering though
            it was for blood. With one hand he caught Achilles’ knees as he besought him, and with
            the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then he said, “Achilles, have
            mercy upon me and spare me, [75] for I am your suppliant. It was in your tents that I
            first broke bread on the day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you
            sold me away to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the price of
            a hundred oxen. [80] I have paid three times as much to gain my freedom; it is but
            twelve days that I have come to Ilion after much suffering, and now cruel fate has again
            thrown me into your hands. Surely father Zeus must hate me, that he has given me over to
            you a second time. [85] Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me, daughter of
            aged Altes—of Altes who reigns over the warlike Leleges and holds steep Pedasos on the
            river Satnioeis. Priam married his daughter along with many other women and two sons
            were born of her, [90] both of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydoros
            as he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for I fear that
            I shall not escape you since a superhuman force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >daimōn</foreign>] has delivered me over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying
            to your heart, [95] spare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your
            gentle but strong comrade.” </p>
          <p>With such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but Achilles answered
            him sternly. “Idiot,” said he, “talk not to me of ransom. [100] Until Patroklos fell I
            preferred to give the Trojans quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had
            taken alive; but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands
            before the city of Ilion—and of all Trojans [105] it shall fare hardest with the sons of
            Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you whine in this way?
            Patroklos fell, and he was a better man than you are. I too—see you not how I am great
            and goodly? I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, [110] but the
            hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day will come, either at dawn
            or dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in battle, either with his
            spear, or with an arrow sped from his bow.”</p>
          <p>[115] Thus did he speak, and Lykaon’s heart sank within him. He loosed his hold of the
            spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles drew his keen blade, and struck
            him by the collar-bone on his neck; he plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very
            hilt, whereon he lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him
            till the earth was soaked. [120] Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung him into
            the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, “Lie there among
            the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall
            not lay you on any bier to mourn you, [125] but the eddies of Skamandros shall bear you
            into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lykaon as
            they dart under the dark ripple of the waters—so perish all of you till we reach the
            citadel of strong Ilion—you in flight, and I following after to destroy you. [130] The
            river with its broad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you
            offered him and all the horses that you flung living into his waters. None the less
            miserably shall you perish till there is not a man of you but has paid in full for the
            death of Patroklos and the havoc you wrought among the Achaeans [135] whom you killed at
            the swift ships in my absence.”</p>
          <p>So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered within himself
            how he should keep radiant Achilles out of the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ponos</foreign>] and save the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus,
            spear in hand, [140] sprang upon Asteropaios son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to
            the broad river Axios and Periboia eldest daughter of Akessamenos; for the river had
            lain with her. Asteropaios stood up out of the water to face him [145] with a spear in
            either hand, and Xanthos filled him with courage, being angry for the death of the
            youths whom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up
            with one another swift-footed radiant Achilles was first to speak. [150] “Who and whence
            are you,” said he, “who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands up against
            me.” And the son of Pelegon answered, “Great son of Peleus, why should you ask my
            lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia, [155] leader of the Paeonians, and
            it is now eleven days that I am at Ilion. I am of the blood of the river Axios—of Axios
            that is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, [160]
            whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash. Asteropaios failed
            with both his spears, for he could use both hands alike; with the one spear he struck
            Achilles’ shield, [165] but did not pierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,
            stayed the point; with the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles’ right arm
            drawing dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the ground,
            foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, [170] fain to kill him, hurled his spear at
            Asteropaios, but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the
            spear half its length into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang
            furiously upon him. Asteropaios vainly tried to draw Achilles’ spear out of the bank by
            main force; three times did he tug at it, [175] trying with all his might to draw it
            out, and three times he had to leave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and
            break it, but before he could do so glorious Achilles smote him with his sword and
            killed him. He struck him in the belly near the navel, [180] so that all his bowels came
            gushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping.
            Then Achilles set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armor, vaunting over him
            and saying, “Lie there – begotten of a river though you be, [185] it is hard for you to
            strive with the offspring of Kronos’ son. You declare yourself sprung from the blood of
            a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Zeus. My father is Peleus, son of Aiakos
            ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aiakos was the son of Zeus. [190] Therefore as Zeus
            is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his children stronger than
            those of any river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can be of
            any use to you, but there is no fighting against Zeus the son of Kronos, with whom not
            even King Akheloos can compare, [195] nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing Okeanos,
            from whom all rivers and seas with all springs and deep wells proceed; even Okeanos
            fears the lightnings of great Zeus, and his thunder that comes crashing out of
            heaven.”</p>
          <p>[200] With this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he had killed
            Asteropaios, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with the dark water flowing over
            him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his
            kidneys. [205] Then he went in chase of the Paeonians, who were fleeing along the bank
            of the river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of
            Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilokhos, Mydon, Astypylos, [210] Mnesos, Thrasios, Oineus,
            and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the river in anger taken
            human form, and spoken to him from out the deep waters saying, “Achilles, if you excel
            all in strength, [215] so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to
            protect you: if, then, the son of Kronos has granted it to you to destroy all the
            Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on land. My fair
            waters are now filled with corpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour
            myself into the sea [220] for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly
            slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O leader of your army, trouble me no further.” </p>
          <p>Achilles answered, “So be it, Skamandros, Zeus-descended; but I will never cease
            dealing out death among the Trojans, [225] till I have pent them up in their city, and
            made trial of Hector face to face, that I may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I
            him.”</p>
          <p>As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of a superhuman force
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimōn</foreign>]. But the river said to Apollo, “Surely,
            son of Zeus, lord of the silver bow, [230] you are not obeying the commands of Zeus who
            charged you strictly that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight
            fades, and darkness is over an the earth.” </p>
          <p>Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, [235] whereon the river raised
            a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into a torrent, and swept away the
            many dead whom Achilles had slain and left within his waters. These he cast out on to
            the land, bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in
            his mighty eddies. [240] The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles, falling
            upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold
            of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, [245] and tore away the bank, damming
            the stream with its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles
            struggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid. </p>
          <p>But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him with a dark-crested
            wave, [250] to keep him out of the struggle [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>]
            and save the Trojans from destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear’s throw
            from him; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and fleetest
            of all birds, even so did he spring forward, [255] and the armor rang loudly about his
            breast. He fled on in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after. As one
            who would water his garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and all
            his ground—spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the channels, [260] and the
            little stones run rolling round and round with the water as it goes merrily down the
            bank faster than the man can follow—even so did the river keep catching up with radiant
            Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. [265] As
            often as he would strive to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in
            heaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating down upon
            his shoulders, and he would have to keep fleeing on and on in great dismay; [270] for
            the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed past him and ate the ground from under
            his feet. </p>
          <p>Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, “Father Zeus, is there
            none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save me from the river? I do not care
            what may happen to me afterwards. [275] I hold responsible [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aitios</foreign>] none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear
            mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to fall under the walls of
            Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would that Hector, the best man among the Trojans,
            might there slay me; [280] then should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now
            it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I
            were some swineherd’s boy, who gets carried down a torrent while trying to cross it
            during a storm.” </p>
          <p>As soon as he had spoken thus, Poseidon and Athena [285] came up to him in the likeness
            of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him. Poseidon spoke first. “Son of
            Peleus,” said he, “be not so exceeding fearful; we are two gods, [290] come with Zeus’
            sanction to assist you, I, and Pallas Athena. It is not your fate to perish in this
            river; he will abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you, if you
            will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting [295] till you have pent the
            Trojan army within the famed walls of Ilion—as many of them as may escape. Then kill
            Hector and go back to the ships, for we will grant you a triumph over him.” </p>
          <p>When they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but Achilles strove onward
            over the plain, encouraged by the charge the gods had laid upon him. [300] All was now
            covered with the flood of waters, and much goodly armor of the youths that had been
            slain was rifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream,
            speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Athena had endowed him
            with great strength. [305] Nevertheless Skamandros did not slacken in his pursuit, but
            was still more furious with the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest
            and cried aloud to Simoeis saying, “Dear brother, let the two of us unite to stop this
            man, or he will ransack the mighty city of King Priam, [310] and the Trojans will not
            hold out against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water from their sources,
            rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones
            come thundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creature. [315] He is in
            a rage, equal to the rage of the gods. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor
            comeliness, nor his fine armor, which indeed shall soon be lying low in the deep waters
            covered over with mud. [320] I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round
            him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for the silt in which I
            shall have hidden him, and when they celebrate his funeral they need build no tomb
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>Then he raised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, [325]seething as it was with
            foam and blood and the bodies of the dead. The dark waters of the river stood upright
            and would have overwhelmed the son of Peleus, but Hera, trembling lest Achilles should
            be swept away in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high [330] and called out to
            Hephaistos her son. “Crooked-foot,” she cried, “my child, be up and doing, for I deem it
            is with you that Xanthos is fain to fight; help us at once, kindle a fierce fire; I will
            then bring up the west and the white south wind in a mighty gale from the sea, [335]
            that shall bear the flames against the heads and armor of the Trojans and consume them,
            while you go along the banks of Xanthos burning his trees and wrapping him round with
            fire. Let him not turn you back neither by fair words nor foul, [340] and slacken not
            till I shout and tell you. Then you may stay your flames.” </p>
          <p>Then Hephaistos kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the plain and burned
            the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose bodies were lying about in great
            numbers; [345] by this means the plain was dried and the flood stayed. As the north
            wind, blowing on an orchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and
            the heart of the owner is glad—even so the whole plain was dried and the dead bodies
            were consumed. [350] Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river. He burned the elms
            the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the rushes and marshy herbage that
            grew abundantly by the banks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about
            everywhere in the water, these, too, [355] were sorely harassed by the flames that
            cunning Hephaistos had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spoke
            saying, “Hephaistos, there is no god can hold his own against you. I cannot fight you
            when you flare out your flames in this way; strive with me no longer. Let radiant
            Achilles drive the Trojans out of the city immediately. [360] What have I to do with
            quarreling and helping people?” </p>
          <p>He was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a cauldron upon a
            large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some fatted hog, and the lard keeps
            bubbling up all over when the dry faggots blaze under it— [365] even so were the goodly
            waters of Xanthos heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer
            but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning
            Hephaistos had raised. Then he prayed to Hera and besought her saying, “Hera, why should
            your son vex my stream [370] with such especial fury? I am not so much responsible
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aitios</foreign>] as all the others are who have been
            helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let your son leave
            off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything to save the Trojans from
            destruction, [375] not even when all Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans
            will kindle.” </p>
          <p>As soon as goddess of the white arms, Hera heard this she said to her son Hephaistos,
            “Son Hephaistos, hold now your flames; [380] we ought not to use such violence against a
            god for the sake of mortals.” </p>
          <p>When she had thus spoken Hephaistos quenched his flames, and the river went back once
            more into his own fair bed. </p>
          <p>Xanthos was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Hera stayed them though she
            was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among the other gods, for they were of
            divided counsels. [385] They fell on one another with a mighty uproar—earth groaned, and
            the spacious firmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Zeus heard as he was
            sitting on Olympus, [390] and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among
            themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Arēs piercer of shields opened the
            battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon Athena and reviled her. “Why, vixen,” said
            he, “have you again set the gods by the ears [395] in the pride and haughtiness of your
            heart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomedes son of Tydeus on to wound me, and
            yourself took a spear in the sight of all and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair
            body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.”</p>
          <p>[400] As he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasseled aegis—so terrible that not
            even can Zeus’ lightning pierce it. Here did manslaughtering Arēs strike her with his
            great spear. She drew back and with her strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the
            plain—great and rugged and black— [405] which men of old had set for the boundary of a
            field. With this she struck Arēs on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods did he
            cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust, while his armor rang
            rattling round him. But Athena laughed and vaunted over him saying, [410] “Idiot, have
            you not learned how far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourself
            against me? Thus do your mother’s curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would
            do you mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping the Trojans.”</p>
          <p>[415] She then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Zeus’ daughter Aphrodite
            took Arēs by the hand and led him away groaning all the time, for it was only with great
            difficulty that he had come to himself again. When Queen Hera saw her, she said to
            Athena, [420] “Look, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearying, that vixen Aphrodite is
            again taking Arēs through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.” </p>
          <p>Thus she spoke. Athena sped after Aphrodite with a will, and made at her, striking her
            on the bosom with her strong hand [425] so that she fell fainting to the ground, and
            there they both lay stretched at full length. Then Athena vaunted over her saying, “May
            all who help the Trojans against the Argives [430] prove just as redoubtable and
            stalwart as Aphrodite did when she came across me while she was helping Arēs. Had this
            been so, we should long since have ended the war by ransacking the strong city of
            Ilion.”</p>
          <p>Goddess of the white arms, Hera smiled as she listened. [435] Meanwhile King Poseidon
            turned to Apollo saying, “Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm’s length? it is
            not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful to us if we
            return to Zeus’ bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without having fought each other;
            [440] therefore come on, you are the younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you,
            for I am older and have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we
            two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilion when we came from Zeus’ house
            and worked for Laomedon a whole year [445] at a stated wage and he gave us his orders. I
            built the Trojans the wall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be
            impregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many-valleyed
            Ida. [450] When, however, the glad seasons [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hōrai</foreign>]
            brought round the time-limit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">telos</foreign>] for payment,
            mighty headstrong Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but
            abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into some distant island.
            [455] He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage,
            furious about the payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this,
            you are now showing favor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] to his people,
            [460] and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their
            wives and children.” </p>
          <p>And King Apollo answered, “Lord of the earthquake, you would not think me moderate
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sōphrōn</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">463</seg> if I
            should fight you on account of mortals, <seg rend="subscript">464</seg> the wretches,
            who are like leaves. At given times, [465] they come to their fullness, bursting forth
            in radiance, eating the crops of the Earth, <seg rend="subscript">466</seg> while at
            other times they wilt [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phthi-nuthousin</foreign>], victims of
            fate. Let us stay this fighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.” </p>
          <p>He turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother of his own father.
            [470] But his sister the huntress Artemis, patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with
            him and said, “So you would flee, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Poseidon with a
            cheap vaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? [475] Never let me again hear
            you bragging in my father’s house, as you have often done in the presence of the
            immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Poseidon.” </p>
          <p>Apollo made her no answer, but Zeus’ august queen was angry [480] and upbraided her
            bitterly. “Bold vixen,” she cried, “how dare you cross me thus? For all your bow you
            will find it hard to hold your own against me. Zeus made you as a lion among women, and
            lets you kill them whenever you choose. [485] You will find it better to chase wild
            beasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If
            you would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself against me, how far stronger
            I am than you are.” </p>
          <p>She caught both Artemis’ wrists with her left hand as she spoke, [490] and with her
            right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as she beat her with it about the
            ears while Artemis wriggled and writhed under her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon
            the ground, and she fled weeping from under Hera’s hand as a dove that flies before a
            falcon [495] to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape.
            Even so did she flee weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her. </p>
          <p>Then the slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, said to Leto, “Leto, I shall not fight
            you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Zeus’ wives. [500] Therefore boast as you
            will among the immortals that you worsted me in fair fight.” </p>
          <p>Leto then gathered up Artemis’ bow and arrows that had fallen about amid the whirling
            dust, and when she had got them she made all haste after her daughter. [505] Artemis had
            now reached Zeus’ bronze-floored mansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many
            tears on the knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about
            her. The son of Kronos drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while began to
            question her saying, “Which of the heavenly beings, my dear child, [510] has been
            treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had been misconducting yourself in the
            face of everybody?” and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, “It was your
            wife Hera of the white arms, father, who has been beating me; it is always her doing
            when there is any quarreling among the immortals.” </p>
          <p>Thus did they converse, [515] and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong city of
            Ilion, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out and the Danaans should take
            the city then and there, before its hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods
            went back, some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats [520]
            beside Zeus lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing out death
            alike on the Trojans and on their horses. As when the smoke from some burning city
            ascends to heaven when the anger [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mēnis</foreign>] of the gods
            has kindled it—there is then toil [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] for all,
            and sorrow for not a few— [525] even so did Achilles bring toil [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] and sorrow on the Trojans. </p>
          <p>Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge Achilles as the
            Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there was none to help them. Presently he
            came down from off the tower and with many a groan [530] went along the wall to give
            orders to the brave warders of the gate. “Keep the gates,” said he, “wide open till the
            people come fleeing into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in rout
            before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are inside and in safety,
            [535] close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding
            inside along with the others.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when these were opened
            there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo then came full speed out of the city
            to meet them [540] and protect them. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with
            thirst and grimy with dust, still they hurried on, with Achilles wielding his spear
            furiously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after glory. </p>
          <p>Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy [545] if Apollo had not
            spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to blameless and powerful Antenor. He put
            courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning against a beech tree
            and shrouded in thick darkness. [550] When Agenor saw Achilles he stood still and his
            heart was clouded with care. “Alas,” said he to himself in his dismay, “if I flee before
            mighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout, [555] he will
            none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it be were I to let Achilles
            drive the others before him, and then flee from the wall to the plain that is behind
            Ilion till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide in the underwood that is there? I could
            then wash the sweat from off me in the river [560] and in the evening return to Ilion.
            But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he would see me as I am hurrying
            from the city over the plain, and would speed after me till he had caught me— [565] I
            should stand no chance against him, for he is mightiest of all humankind. What, then, if
            I go out and meet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by
            pointed bronze. Life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] is the same in one and
            all, and men say that he is but mortal [570] despite the triumph that Zeus, son of
            Kronos, grants him.” </p>
          <p>So saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now fain to fight him.
            As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert to attack a hunter— [575] she knows
            no fear and is not dismayed by the baying of the hounds; even though the man be too
            quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has
            pierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been
            killed outright— [580] even so did noble Agenor son of radiant Antenor refuse to flee
            till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding his
            round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. “Of a truth,” said he, “noble
            Achilles, you deem that you shall this day ransack the city of the proud Trojans. [585]
            Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us
            still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children, to
            defend Ilion. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you
            die.”</p>
          <p>[590] As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear struck
            Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly wrought tin rang loudly, but
            the spear recoiled from the body of him whom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for
            the god’s gift stayed it. [595] Achilles in his turn attacked godlike Agenor, but Apollo
            would not grant him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist,
            sending him out of the battle to go away serene [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >hēsukhos</foreign>]. Then he craftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after
            the army, [600] for he put on the semblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles,
            who ran towards him to give him chase and pursued him over the wheat lands of the plain,
            turning him towards the deep waters of the river Skamandros. Apollo ran but a little way
            before him [605] and beguiled Achilles by making him think all the time that he was on
            the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to
            crowd within the city till their numbers thronged it; [610] no longer did they dare wait
            for one another outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were fallen in
            fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them poured pell-mell into the
            town.</p>

        <div n="2">
          <head>Rhapsody 22</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat
            from off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly battlements,
            while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their shoulders drew close up to the
            walls. [5] But stern fate bade Hector stay where he was before Ilion and the Scaean
            gates. Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, “Why, son of Peleus, do
            you, who are only a man, give chase to me who am immortal? [10] Have you not yet found
            out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not inflict struggles
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">ponos</foreign>] on the Trojans whom you had routed, and now
            they are within their walls, while you have been decoyed here away from them. Me you
            cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.” </p>
          <p>Achilles of the swift feet was greatly angered and said, [15] “You have thwarted me,
            Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the wall, where many
            another man would have bitten the dust before he got within Ilion; you have robbed me of
            great glory and have saved the Trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to
            fear, [20] but I would indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.” </p>
          <p>Then, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning horse in a chariot
            race strains every nerve when he is flying over the plain, even so fast and furiously
            did the limbs of Achilles bear him onwards. [25] Old King Priam was first to note him as
            he scoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion’s Hound, and whose
            beams blaze forth in time of harvest more radiantly than those of any other that shines
            by night; brightest of them all though he be, [30] he yet sends an ill sign [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his
            train—even so did Achilles’ armor gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a
            cry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up [35] and shouted out to his
            dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, for his
            heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards
            him and bade him for pity’s sake come within the walls. “Hector,” he cried, “my son,
            stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, [40] or you will meet death at the
            hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is; would
            indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon
            devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and a load of grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>] would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son has he taken
            away from me, [45] either by killing them or selling them away in the islands that are
            beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within
            the city, Lykaon and Polydoros, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be
            still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, [50] we will ransom them with gold and
            bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but
            if they are already dead and in the house of Hādēs, sorrow will it be to us two who were
            their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived [55] unless you too
            perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the guardian
            of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty
            triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also on your unhappy father [60] while life yet
            remains to him—on me, whom the son of Kronos will destroy by a terrible doom on the
            threshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters hauled away as
            captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earth amid the rage of
            battle, [65] and my sons’ wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the
            end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the
            life out of my body with sword or spear—hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own
            table to guard my gates, [70] but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught
            at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he is and
            there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is honorable in death, but when an
            old man is slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should
            defile [75] his gray hair and beard and all that men hide for shame [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>The old man tore his gray hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart of Hector. His
            mother hard by wept and moaned aloud [80] as she bared her bosom and pointed to the
            breast which had suckled him. “Hector,” she cried, weeping bitterly the while, “Hector,
            my son, spurn not this breast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you
            comfort from my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall to
            protect us from this man; [85] stand not without to meet him. Should the wretch kill
            you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of myself,
            over the bed on which you lie, for dogs will devour you at the ships of the
            Achaeans.”</p>
          <p>[90] Thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not the heart
            of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as he drew nearer towards him.
            As serpent in its den upon the mountains, full fed with deadly poisons, [95] waits for
            the approach of man—he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes
            writhing round his den—even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted out
            from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted. </p>
          <p>“Alas,” said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, “if I go within the gates,
            [100] Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me, for it was he that urged me
            to lead the Trojans back to the city on that awful night when Achilles again came forth
            against us. I would not listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so.
            Now that my folly has destroyed the army, [105] I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan
            women in the face, lest a worse man should say, ‘Hector has ruined us by his
            self-confidence.’ Surely it would be better for me to return after having fought
            Achilles and slain him, [110] or to die gloriously here before the city. What, again, if
            I were to lay down my shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight
            up to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was the
            fountainhead of all this war, [115] and all the treasure that Alexandros brought with
            him in his ships to Troy, yes, and to let the Achaeans divide the half of everything
            that the city contains among themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of
            their princes, [120] take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would divide
            into two shares all that is within the city— <seg rend="subscript">122</seg> But why do
            I have these things to talk about with my spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>]? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would
            kill me then and there as easily [125] as though I were a woman, when I had off my
              armor. <seg rend="subscript">126</seg> It is by now impossible to converse with him,
            starting from the oak or from the rock as young men and maidens prattle with one
            another. Better fight him at once, [130] and learn to which of us Zeus will grant
            victory.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were Arēs himself,
            plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he brandished his terrible spear of
            Pelian ash, [135] and the bronze gleamed around him like flashing fire or the rays of
            the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer
            where he was but fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him
            at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, [140] swoops down upon
            some cowering dove—the dove flies before him but the falcon with a shrill scream follows
            close after, resolved to have her—even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all
            his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take
            him.</p>
          <p>[145] On they flew along the wagon-road that ran hard by under the wall, past the
            lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree, till they came to two fair
            springs which feed the river Skamandros. [150] One of these two springs is warm, and
            steam rises from it as smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as
            cold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the
            goodly washing-troughs of stone, [155] where in the time of peace before the coming of
            the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes.
            Past these did they flee, the one in front and the other giving chase behind him: good
            was the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did
            they run, for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock’s hide, [160] as it
            might be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round the
            turning-posts when they are running for some great prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >āthlon</foreign>]—a tripod or woman—at the games in honor of some dead hero, [165] so
            did these two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the gods watched
            them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak. </p>
          <p>“Alas,” said he, “my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued round the walls
            of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, [170] who has burned the thigh-bones of
            many a heifer in my honor, at one while on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the
            citadel of Troy; and now I see radiant Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of
            Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves [175] and decide whether we shall now
            save him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of Peleus.” </p>
          <p>Then owl-vision goddess Athena said, “Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud
            and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal [180] whose doom has long been
            decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others shall not be of a mind
            with you.” </p>
          <p>And Zeus answered, “My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak in full earnest,
            and I will let you have your way. [185] Do as your thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>] tells you, without letting up, without hindrance.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he urge Athena who was already eager, and down she darted from the topmost
            summits of Olympus. </p>
          <p>Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, [190] as a hound chasing a fawn which he
            has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts through glade and thicket. The
            fawn may try to elude him by crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out
            and follow her up until he gets her—even so there was no escape for Hector from the
            swift-footed son of Peleus. [195] Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian gates
            and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering down weapons from
            above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself
            always on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he
            is pursuing [200] —the one cannot escape nor the other overtake—even so neither could
            Achilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might
            even yet have escaped death had not the time come when Apollo, who thus far had
            sustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer to stay by him. [205]
            Radiant Achilles made signs to the Achaean army, and shook his head to show that no man
            was to aim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he
            might himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for the
            fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of
            them, [210] one for Achilles and the other for Hector, breaker of horses. As he held the
            scales by the middle, <seg rend="subscript">212</seg> Hector’s day of doom came, <seg
              rend="subscript">213</seg> and he went off to Hādēs. Apollo left him. Then owl-vision
            Athena went close up to the son of Peleus and said, [215] “Noble Achilles, favored of
            heaven, I think in my mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] we two shall surely
            take back to the ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust of
            battle. [220] Do what Apollo may as he lies groveling before his father, aegis-bearing
            Zeus, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and take breath, while I go up to him
            and persuade him to make a stand and fight you.” </p>
          <p>Thus spoke Athena. Achilles obeyed her gladly, [225] and stood still, leaning on his
            bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Athena left him and went after radiant Hector in the
            form and with the voice of Deiphobos. She came close up to him and said, <seg
              rend="subscript">229</seg> “Dear brother, indeed swift Achilles uses <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign> against you, [230] as he chases you with swift feet
            around the city of Priam. Let us await his onset and stand on our defense.” </p>
          <p>And Hector answered, “Deiphobos, you have always been dearest to me of all my brothers,
            children of Hecuba and Priam, [235] but henceforth I shall rate you yet more highly,
            inasmuch as you have ventured outside the wall for my sake when all the others remain
            inside.” Then owl-vision goddess Athena said, “Dear brother, my father and mother went
            down on their knees and implored me, [240] as did all my comrades, to remain inside, so
            great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of grief when I beheld you;
            now, therefore, let us two make a stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our
            spears in reserve, [245] that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off
            our spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you.” </p>
          <p>Thus did Athena inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now close to one
            another great helmet-glittering Hector was first to speak. [250] “I will no longer flee
            you, son of Peleus,” said he, “as I have been doing hitherto. Three times have I fled
            round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either
            slay or be slain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one
            another by our gods, [255] who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants;
            let it be agreed between us that if Zeus grants me the longer stay and I take your life
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>], I am not to treat your dead body in any
            unseemly fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armor, I am to give up your body
            to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.”</p>
          <p>[260] Swift-footed Achilles glared at him and answered, “Fool, prate not to me about
            covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and lambs can never
            be of one mind, but hate each other out and out all through. [265] Therefore there can
            be no understanding between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us, till
            one or other shall fall and glut grim Arēs with his life’s blood. Be mindful of all your
            excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>]; you have need now to prove
            yourself indeed a bold warrior and fighter. [270] You have no more chance, and Pallas
            Athena will right then and there vanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full
            for the grief you have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in
            battle.” </p>
          <p>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Glorious Hector saw it coming and
            avoided it; [275] he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his head and
            stuck in the ground beyond; Athena then snatched it up and gave it back to Achilles
            without Hector’s seeing her; Hector then said to the blameless son of Peleus, “You have
            missed your aim, Achilles, peer of the gods, [280] and Zeus has not yet revealed to you
            the hour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued
            liar when you deemed that I should forget my valor and quail before you. You shall not
            drive spear into the back of a runaway—drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive
            it into me as I make straight towards you; [285] and now for your own part avoid my
            spear if you can—would that you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you
            were once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you who have
            harmed them most.” </p>
          <p>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. [290] His aim was true for he hit the
            middle of Achilles’ shield, but the spear rebounded from it, and did not pierce it.
            Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood
            there in dismay for he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobos and
            asked him for one, [295] but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to
            himself, “Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I thought that the hero
            Deiphobos was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Athena has inveigled me; [300]
            death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it—for so Zeus
            and his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever
            ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and
            without a struggle, [305] but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among
            men hereafter.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his side, and
            gathering himself together he sprang on Achilles like a soaring eagle which swoops down
            from the clouds [310] on to some lamb or timid hare—even so did Hector brandish his
            sword and spring upon Achilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his
            wondrous shield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four layers of
            metal, nodding fiercely forward. [315] The thick tresses of gold with which Hephaistos
            had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the evening star that shines brighter
            than all others through the stillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear
            which Achilles poised in his right hand, [320] fraught with the death of noble Hector.
            He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but all was
            protected by the goodly armor of which Hector had spoiled Patroklos after he had slain
            him, save only the throat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders,
            [325] and this is the quickest place for the life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] to escape: here then did radiant Achilles strike him as he was
            coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy part of
            the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak. [330] Hector
            fell headlong, and radiant Achilles vaunted over him saying, “Hector, you thought that
            you would come off unscathed when you were despoiling Patroklos, and you did not think
            of me, who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than
            he, was still left behind him at the ships, [335] and now I have laid you low. The
            Achaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures shall work their
            will upon yourself.” </p>
          <p>Then Hector of the shining helmet said, as the life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] ebbed out of him, “I pray you by your life and knees, and by your
            parents, let not dogs devour me at the ships of the Achaeans, [340] but accept the rich
            treasure of gold and bronze which my father and mother will offer you, and send my body
            home, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead.” </p>
          <p>Swift-footed Achilles glared at him and answered, [345] “Dog, talk not to me neither of
            knees nor parents; <seg rend="subscript">346</seg> I wish that somehow my <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign> impelled
              me <seg rend="subscript">347</seg> to slice you up and eat your meat raw, for the
            things you did,  as nothing shall save you from the dogs—it shall not be, [350] though
            they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the spot, with promise
            of yet more hereafter. Though Priam, son of Dardanos, should bid them offer me your
            weight in gold, even so your mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son
            she bore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up.”</p>
          <p>[355] Hector with his dying breath then said, “I know you what you are, and was sure
            that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron; look to it that I bring not
            heaven’s anger upon you on the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be,
            [360] shall slay you at the Scaean gates.” </p>
          <p>When he had thus said the shrouds of death’s final outcome [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >telos</foreign>] enfolded him, whereon his life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] went out of him and flew down to the house of Hādēs, lamenting its
            sad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. But radiant Achilles said,
            speaking to the dead body, [365] “Die; for my part I will accept my fate whenever Zeus
            and the other gods see fit to send it.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side; then he stripped
            the blood-stained armor from Hector’s shoulders while the other Achaeans came running up
            [370] to view his wondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him without giving
            him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbor and say, “It is easier to handle
            Hector now than when he was flinging fire on to our ships” [375] and as he spoke he
            would thrust his spear into him anew. </p>
          <p>When swift-footed radiant Achilles had done despoiling Hector of his armor, he stood
            among the Argives and said, “My friends, princes and counselors of the Argives, now that
            heaven has granted us to overcome this man, [380] who has done us more hurt than all the
            others together, consider whether we should not attack the city in force, and discover
            in what mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] the Trojans may be. We should
            thus learn whether they will desert their city now that Hector has fallen, or will still
            hold out even though he is no longer living. [385] But why argue with myself in this
            way, while Patroklos is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned—he whom I can
            never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not? Though men forget their
            dead when once they are within the house of Hādēs, [390] yet not even there will I
            forget the comrade whom I have lost. <seg rend="subscript">391</seg> Come, young
            warriors of the Achaeans, let us sing a beautiful paean <seg rend="subscript"
            >392</seg> and return to the hollow ships, and bring him along. <seg rend="subscript"
              >393</seg> We won a big <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kudos</foreign>; we killed brilliant
            Hector,  to whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god.”</p>
          <p>[395] Then he treated the body of glorious Hector with contumely: he pierced the sinews
            at the back of both his feet from heel to ankle and passed thongs of ox-hide through the
            slits he had made: thus he made the body fast to his chariot, letting the head trail
            upon the ground. Then when he had put the goodly armor on the chariot and had himself
            mounted, [400] he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath. The dust
            rose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his
            head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Zeus had now delivered him into the hands
            of his foes to do him outrage in his own land.</p>
          <p>[405] Thus was the head of Hector being dishonored in the dust. His mother tore her
            hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she looked upon her son. His father
            made piteous moan, and throughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. [410]
            It was as though the whole of frowning Ilion was being smirched with fire. Hardly could
            the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city. He
            groveled in the mire and besought them, [415] calling each one of them by his name. “Let
            be, my friends,” he cried, “and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to
            the ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will
            respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. [420] His own
            father is even such another as myself—Peleus, who bred him and reared him—to be the bane
            of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain in
            the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, [425] I do so for
            one—Hector—more than for them all, and the bitterness of my sorrow [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">akhos</foreign>] will bring me down to the house of Hādēs. Would that
            he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him, and myself,
            should have had the comfort of weeping and mourning over him.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city joined in his lament.
            [430] Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the Trojans. “Alas, my son,” she
            cried, “what have I left to live for now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory
            in you throughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, [435] and
            both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their pride,
            but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">437</seg> So she [= Hecuba] spoke, lamenting, but the wife [=
            Andromache] had not yet heard, <seg rend="subscript">438</seg> Hector’s wife: for no
            true messenger had come to her <seg rend="subscript">439</seg> and told her the news,
            how her husband was standing his ground outside the gates. [440] She [= Andromache] was
            weaving [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">huphainein</foreign>] a web in the inner room of the
            lofty palace, <seg rend="subscript">441</seg> a purple [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >porphureē</foreign>] fabric that folds in two [= <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >diplax</foreign>], and she was inworking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >en-passein</foreign>] patterns of flowers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">throna</foreign>]
            that were varied [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">poikila</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
              >442</seg> And she called out to the attending women, the ones with the beautiful
            tresses [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">plokamoi</foreign>], in the palace <seg
              rend="subscript">443</seg> to set a big tripod on the fire, so that there would
              be <seg rend="subscript">444</seg> a warm bath for Hector when he had his return
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nostos</foreign>] from battle. [445] Unwary [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">nēpiē</foreign>] as she was, she did not know [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">noeîn</foreign>] that, far from the bath, <seg rend="subscript"
              >446</seg> the hands of Achilles had brought him [= Hector] down. It was the work of
            Athena, the one with the look of the owl. <seg rend="subscript">447</seg> She [=
            Andromache] heard the wailing and the cries of oimoi coming from the high walls
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">purgos</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript">448</seg> Her limbs
            shook, and she dropped on the ground her shuttle. <seg rend="subscript">449</seg> And
            then she stood among the women slaves attending her, the ones with the beautiful
            tresses, and she spoke to them: [450] “Come, I want two of you to accompany me. I want
            to see what has happened <seg rend="subscript">451</seg> I just heard the voice of my
            venerable mother-in-law, and what I feel inside is that <seg rend="subscript"
            >452</seg> my heart is throbbing hard in my chest right up to my mouth, and my knees
            down below <seg rend="subscript">453</seg> are frozen stiff. I now see that something
            bad is nearing the sons of Priam. <seg rend="subscript">454</seg> If only the spoken
            word had been too far away for me to hear. But I so terribly [455] fear for my bold
            Hector at the hands of radiant Achilles. <seg rend="subscript">456</seg> I fear that he
            has got him cut off from the rest, putting him on the run toward the open plain, <seg
              rend="subscript">457</seg> and that he has put a stop to a manliness that has gone too
            far, the cause of so much sorrow. <seg rend="subscript">458</seg> It was a thing that
            had a hold over him, since he could never just stand back and blend in with the
            multitude of his fellow warriors. <seg rend="subscript">459</seg>Instead, he would keep
            on running ahead of the rest of them, not yielding to anyone as he pushed ahead with his
            vital force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>[460] She [= Andromache] rushed out of the palace, same as a maenad [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mainas</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">461</seg> with heart
            throbbing. And her attending women went with her. <seg rend="subscript">462</seg> But
            when she reached the tower and the crowd of warriors, <seg rend="subscript"
            >463</seg> she stood on the wall, looking around, and then she noticed him. <seg
              rend="subscript">464</seg> There he was, being dragged right in front of the city. The
            swift chariot team of horses was [465] dragging him, far from her caring thoughts, back
            toward the hollow ships of the Achaeans. <seg rend="subscript">466</seg> Over her eyes a

              rend="subscript">468</seg> She threw far from her head the splendid adornments that
            bound her hair <seg rend="subscript">469</seg> —her frontlet [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ampux</foreign>], her snood [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kekruphalos</foreign>], her
            plaited headband [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">anadesmē</foreign>], [470] and, to top it
            all, the headdress [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">krēdemnon</foreign>] that had been given to
            her by golden Aphrodite <seg rend="subscript">471</seg> on that day when Hector, the one
            with the waving plume on his helmet, took her by the hand and led her <seg
              rend="subscript">472</seg> out from the palace of Eëtion, and he gave countless
            courtship presents. <seg rend="subscript">473</seg> Crowding around her stood her
            husband’s sisters and his brothers’ wives, <seg rend="subscript">474</seg> and they were
            holding her up. She was barely breathing, to the point of dying. [475] But when she
            recovered her breathing and her life’s breath gathered in her heart, <seg
              rend="subscript">476</seg> she started to sing a lament in the midst of the Trojan
            women.</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">477</seg> “Hector, I too am wretched. For we were born sharing a
            single fate, <seg rend="subscript">478</seg> the two of us—you in Troy, in the palace of
              Priam, <seg rend="subscript">479</seg> and I in Thebe, the city at the foot of the
            wooded mountain of Plakos [480] in the palace of Eëtion, who raised me when I was
              little <seg rend="subscript">481</seg> —an ill-fated father and a daughter with an
            equally terrible fate. If only he had never fathered me. <seg rend="subscript"
            >482</seg> But now you [= Hektor] are headed for the palace of Hādēs inside the deep
            recesses of earth, <seg rend="subscript">483</seg> that is where you are headed, while I
            am left behind by you, left behind in a state of hateful mourning [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>], <seg rend="subscript">484</seg> a widow in the
            palace. And then there is the child, not yet bonded to you, so young he is, [485] whose
            parents we are, you and I with our wretched fate. Neither will you be for him, <seg
              rend="subscript">486</seg> no you will not, Hektor, of any help, since you died, nor
            will he be of any help for you, <seg rend="subscript">487</seg> even if he escapes the
            attack of the Achaeans, with all its sorrows, <seg rend="subscript">488</seg> still, for
            the rest of his life, because of you, there will be harsh labor for him, <seg
              rend="subscript">489</seg> and sorrows. For others will take his landholdings away
            from him. The time of bereavement [490] leaves the child with no agemates as
              friends. <seg rend="subscript">491</seg> He bows his head to every man, and his cheeks
            are covered with tears. <seg rend="subscript">492</seg> The boy makes his rounds among
            his father’s former companions, <seg rend="subscript">493</seg> and he tugs at one man
            by the mantle and another man by the tunic, <seg rend="subscript">494</seg> and they
            pity him. One man gives him a small drink from a cup, [495] enough to moisten the boy’s
            lips but not enough to moisten his palate. <seg rend="subscript">496</seg> But another
            boy whose parents are living hits him and chases him from the banquet, <seg
              rend="subscript">497</seg> beating him with his fists and abusing him with words: <seg
              rend="subscript">498</seg> “Get out, you! Your father is not dining with us!” <seg
              rend="subscript">499</seg> And the boy goes off in tears to his widowed mother, [500]
            the boy Astyanax, who in days gone by, on the knees of his father, <seg rend="subscript"
              >501</seg> would eat only the marrow or the meat of sheep that were the fattest. <seg
              rend="subscript">502</seg> And when sleep would come upon him after he was finished
            with playing, <seg rend="subscript">503</seg> he would go to sleep in a bed, in the arms
            of his nurse, <seg rend="subscript">504</seg> in a soft bed, with a heart that is filled
            in luxury. [505] But now he [= our child] will suffer many things, deprived of his
              father, <seg rend="subscript">506</seg> our child Astyanax, as the Trojans call him by
              name. <seg rend="subscript">507</seg> That is what he is called because you all by
            yourself guarded the gates and long walls. <seg rend="subscript">508</seg> But now, you
            are where the curved ships [of the Achaeans] are, far from your parents, <seg
              rend="subscript">509</seg> and you will be devoured by writhing maggots after the dogs
            have their fill of you. [510] There you lie, naked, while your clothes are lying around
            in the palace. <seg rend="subscript">511</seg> Fine clothes they are, marked by
            pleasurable beauty [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>], the work of women’s
              hands. <seg rend="subscript">512</seg> But I will incinerate all these clothes over
            the burning fire. <seg rend="subscript">513</seg> You will have no need for them, since
            you will not be lying in state, clothed in them. <seg rend="subscript">514</seg> But
            there is to be fame [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>] [for you] from the men
            and women of Troy.”</p>
          <p>[515] So she [= Andromache] spoke, weeping, and the women mourned in response.</p>

          <head>Rhapsody 23</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] Thus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the
            Achaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship. But
            Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, [5] and spoke to his brave comrades saying,
            “Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends, not yet, I say, let us unyoke,
            but with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroklos, in due honor to
            the dead. [10] When we have had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses
            and take supper all of us here.”</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">12</seg>Then they all all wailed together, and Achilles led them.
            Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round the body, and Thetis stirred
            within them a still deeper yearning. [15] The sands of the seashore and the men’s armor
            were wet with their weeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. <seg
              rend="subscript">17</seg> The son of Peleus [=Achilles] led them [= the Myrmidons] in
            a pulsating song of lamentation [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">goos</foreign>]: he laid his
            bloodstained hands on the breast of his friend. “Fare well,” he cried, “Patroklos, even
            in the house of Hādēs. [20] I will now do all that I once upon a time promised you; I
            will drag Hector here and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I
            also slay before your pyre to avenge you.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he treated the body of glorious Hector with contumely, [25] laying it at
            full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos. The others then put off every man
            his armor, took the horses from their chariots, and seated themselves in great multitude
            by the ship of the swift-footed descendant of Aiakos, who then feasted them with an
            abundant funeral banquet. [30] Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did
            they butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe
            and set to roast in the flames of Hephaistos; and rivulets of blood flowed all round the
            place where the body was lying.</p>
          <p>[35] Then the princes of the Achaeans took the swift-footed son of Peleus to Agamemnon,
            but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so angry was he for the death of
            his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon’s tent they told the serving-men [40] to
            set a large tripod over the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus to wash
            the clotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn
            oath, saying, “Nay, by King Zeus, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not right
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] that water should touch my body, [45] till
            I have laid Patroklos on the flames, have built him a tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign>], and shaved my head— <seg rend="subscript">46</seg> for never
              again <seg rend="subscript">47</seg> will sorrow [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>] like this enter my heart while I am among the living. Now,
            therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King
            Agamemnon, [50] bid your men bring wood, and provide all else that the dead may duly
            take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the
            sooner, and the people shall turn again to their own labors.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. [55] They made haste to prepare
            the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. <seg
              rend="subscript">58</seg> Τhe others went to their rest each to his own tent, <seg
              rend="subscript">59</seg> but only the son of Peleus, by the shore of the resounding
            sea, [60] only he amidst all his many Myrmidons lay grieving with deep groans <seg
              rend="subscript">61</seg> in an open place on the beach where the waves came surging
            in, one after another. <seg rend="subscript">62</seg> Here sleep took hold of him,
            releasing him from the cares in his heart. <seg rend="subscript">63</seg> It was a sweet
            sleep that poured all over him, since his shining limbs had been worn down <seg
              rend="subscript">64</seg>with chasing Hector round windy Ilion. [65] Then came to him
            the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] of unhappy Patroklos, <seg
              rend="subscript">66</seg> resembling in every way the man himself in size and good
              looks <seg rend="subscript">67</seg> and voice. It [= the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] even wore the same clothes he used to wear over his skin. <seg
              rend="subscript">68</seg> It [= the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>] stood
            over his head and addressed to him these words:</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">69</seg> “You sleep, Achilles. As for me, you have forgotten all
            about me; [70] you used to be not at all uncaring about me when I was alive, but now
            that I am dead you care for me no further. <seg rend="subscript">71</seg> Bury me with
            all speed that I may pass through the gates of Hādēs. <seg rend="subscript"
            >72</seg> Keeping me away from there are the spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhai</foreign>], who are images [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">eidōla</foreign>] of men
            who have ended their struggles; <seg rend="subscript">73</seg> they [= the spirits] are
            not yet permitting me to join them beyond the river. <seg rend="subscript">74</seg> So
            that is how it is, and that is how I am, directionless, at the entrance to the wide
            gates of the house of Hādēs. [75] Give me now your hand while I weep, and I do weep
            because never again <seg rend="subscript">76</seg> will I return from the house of Hādēs
            once you all do what you have to do, which is, to let me have the ritual of fire. <seg
              rend="subscript">77</seg> And never again will you [= Achilles] and I be alive
            together as we sit around only in each other’s company, separating ourselves from our
            dear comrades [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">hetairoi</foreign>], while we keep on sharing,
            just the two of us, <seg rend="subscript">78</seg> our thoughts with each other. My fate
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kēr</foreign>] has its hold on me, <seg rend="subscript"
              >79</seg> that hateful thing. Now it has opened its gaping jaws and swallowed me. It
            really always had its hold on me, ever since I was born. [80] But you, Achilles, you who
            look just like the gods [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">theoeikelos</foreign>], you too have a
            fate [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">moira</foreign>] that has its hold on you. <seg
              rend="subscript">81</seg> You too are fated to die beneath the walls of the noble
            Trojans.</p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">82</seg> I will tell you one more thing, and I call on you to
              comply. <seg rend="subscript">83</seg> Do not let my bones be laid to rest apart from
            your bones, Achilles, <seg rend="subscript">84</seg> but together with them—the same way
            we were brought up together in your own home, [85] back when I, still a boy, was brought
            from Opous by [my father] Menoitios. <seg rend="subscript">86</seg> He brought me to
            your place because of a disastrous [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">lugrē</foreign>]
              homicide. <seg rend="subscript">87</seg> It happened on the day when I killed the son
            of Amphidamas. <seg rend="subscript">88</seg> It was involuntary. I was feeling
            disconnected [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">nēpios</foreign>]. I got angry during a game of
              dice. <seg rend="subscript">89</seg> But then [your father] the charioteer Peleus
            received me in his home, [90] and he raised me in a ritually correct way, naming me to
            be your attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>]. <seg rend="subscript"
              >91</seg> So now let the same container enclose our bones for both of us. <seg
              rend="subscript">92</seg> I mean, the two-handled golden vase given to you by that
            lady, your mother.”</p>
          <p>And swift-footed Achilles answered, “Why, true heart, [95] are you come here to lay
            these charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you have bidden me. Draw closer
            to me, let us once more throw our arms around one another, and find sad comfort in the
            sharing of our sorrows.” </p>
          <p>He opened his arms towards him as he spoke [100] and would have clasped him in them,
            but there was nothing, and the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]
            vanished as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,
            smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, “Of a truth even in the house of Hādēs
            there are spirits [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhai</foreign>] and phantoms that have no
            life in them; [105] all night long the sad spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] of Patroklos has hovered overhead making a piteous moan, telling me
            what I am to do for him, and looking wondrously like himself.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about the poor dumb
            dead, [110] till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King Agamemnon sent men and mules
            from all parts of the camp, to bring wood, and Meriones, attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went
            out [115] with woodmen’s axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before them went the
            mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight ways and crooked, and when they
            reached the heights of many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a
            tall branching oak [120] that came thundering down as they felled it. They split the
            trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best could
            through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs,
            for so Meriones attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] to Idomeneus had
            bidden them. [125] They [= the Achaeans] placed them [the logs] in a row on the
            promontory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aktē</foreign>] where Achilles<seg rend="subscript"
              >126</seg> had marked out the place of a great tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >ērion</foreign>] for Patroklos and for his own self. </p>
          <p>When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole ground, they stayed
            all of them where they were, [130] but Achilles ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on
            their armor, and to yoke each man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armor
            and mounted each his chariot—they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went
            before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after.
            In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroklos [135] and covered him with the locks of
            their hair which they cut off and threw upon his body. Last came radiant Achilles with
            his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hādēs. </p>
          <p>When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid the body down and
            built up the wood. [140] Radiant swift-footed Achilles then turned his thoughts to
            another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the yellow lock which he
            had let grow for the river Sperkheios. He looked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], and said, “Sperkheios, in vain did my
            father Peleus vow to you [145] that when I returned home to my loved native land I
            should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to
            sacrifice to you there at your springs, where is your grove and your altar fragrant with
            burnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilled the thinking
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] of his prayer; [150] now, therefore, that I
            shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroklos.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and all who stood by
            were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun would have gone down upon their
            mourning [155] had not Achilles presently said to Agamemnon, “Son of Atreus, for it is
            to you that the people will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from
            mourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners: we, to
            whom the dead is dearest, [160] will see to what is wanted here, and let the other
            princes also stay by me.” </p>
          <p>When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships, but those who
            were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre a hundred feet this way and that;
            [165] then they laid the dead all sorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and
            dressed many fat sheep and oxen before the pyre, and great-hearted Achilles took fat
            from all of them and wrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed
            carcasses all round it. [170] Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and
            unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he did
            so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the
            pyre; [175] he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them
            with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then he committed all to the
            resistless and devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead
            comrade by name. “Fare well,” he cried, “Patroklos, even in the house of Hādēs; [180] I
            am now doing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the
            flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh of Hector
            son of Priam.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, [185] for Zeus’
            daughter Aphrodite kept them off him night and day, and anointed him with ambrosial oil
            of roses that his flesh might not be torn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus
            Apollo moreover sent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, [190] which gave shade to the
            whole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body. </p>
          <p>Now the pyre about dead Patroklos would not kindle. Swift-footed radiant Achilles
            therefore had thoughts of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two winds
            [195] Boreas and Zephyros vowing them goodly offerings. He made them many
            drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and help him that the wood
            might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying
            and started off to fetch the winds. [200] They were holding high feast in the house of
            boisterous Zephyros when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and
            stood there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her and each of
            them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. “I cannot stay,” she said, [205] “I
            must go back to the streams of Okeanos and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering
            hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that Boreas
            and shrill Zephyros will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; [210] he would
            have you blow upon the pyre of Patroklos for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting.” </p>
          <p>With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent the air and swept
            the clouds before them. They blew on and on until they came to the sea [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], [215] and the waves rose high beneath them, but
            when they reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared under the
            blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and beat upon the fire, and all
            night long did swift-footed Achilles grasp his double cup, [220] drawing wine from a
            mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the spirit [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>] of unhappy dead Patroklos as he poured it upon the ground until the
            earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of his bridegroom
            son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents, [225] even so did Achilles mourn
            while burning the body of his comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and
            lamentation. </p>
          <p>At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which saffron-mantled
            Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames fell and the fire began to die. [230]
            The winds then went home beyond the Thracian sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>], which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus
            now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he fell into a
            sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and
            roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming. [235] He sat upright and said, “Son
            of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon
            the fire and quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroklos, son of Menoitios,
            [240] singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of
            the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at
            the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the
            time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hādēs. [245] I [= Achilles] command
            that you [= the Achaeans] make a tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tumbos</foreign>], not
            very big, <seg rend="subscript">246</seg> just big enough for now. Later, this same tomb
            you Achaeans <seg rend="subscript">247</seg>must make very wide and very high—those of
            you who, after me,  <seg rend="subscript">248</seg> will be left behind, you with your
            ships that have many benches.” </p>
          <p>Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the swift-footed son of Peleus. [250] First
            they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire. With many
            tears they singled out the whitened bones of their gentle comrade and laid them within a
            golden urn in two layers of fat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took
            it inside the tent. [255] They marked off the circle where the tomb [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] should be, made a foundation for it about the pyre,
            and right away heaped up the earth. When they had thus raised a mound as a tomb
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], they were going away, but Achilles stayed
            the people and made them sit in assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>]. He
            brought prizes from the ships—cauldrons, tripods, [260] horses and mules, noble oxen,
            women with fair waistbands, and swart iron. </p>
          <p>The first prize he offered was for the chariot races—a woman skilled in all useful
            arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two
            measures. This was for the man who came in first. [265] For the second there was a
            six-year old mare, unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly
            cauldron that had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the
            maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents of gold, [270] and
            the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among
            the Argives saying, </p>
          <p>“Son of Atreus, and all other strong-greaved Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie
            waiting the winners in the contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of the
            chariot races. At any other time [275] I should carry off the first prize and take it to
            my own tent; you know how much my steeds are better in excellence [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] than all others—for they are immortal; Poseidon gave
            them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold aloof, I
            and my steeds [280] that have lost the glory [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kleos</foreign>]
            of their brave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear water and
            anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes
            trailing on the ground in the extremity of their sorrow. [285] But you others set
            yourselves in order throughout the army, whosoever has confidence in his horses and in
            the strength of his chariot.”</p>
          <p>Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred themselves. First
            among them all stood up Eumelos, king of men, son of Admetos, a man excellent in
            charioteering. [290] Next to him rose mighty Diomedes, son of Tydeus; he yoked the
            Trojan horses which he had taken from Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight.
            Next to him, yellow-haired Menelaos son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses,
            Agamemnon’s mare, Aithe, [295] and his own horse, Podargos. The mare had been given to
            Agamemnon by Ekhepolos son of Anchises, that he might not have to follow him to Ilion,
            but might stay at home and take his ease; for Zeus had endowed him with great wealth and
            he lived in spacious Sicyon. [300] This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaos put
            under the yoke. </p>
          <p>Fourth in order Antilokhos, son to noble Nestor, son of high-hearted Neleus, made ready
            his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up to him [305] to give him
            good advice of which, however, he stood in but little need. “Antilokhos,” said Nestor,
            “you are young, but Zeus and Poseidon have loved you well, and have made you an
            excellent charioteer. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are
            skillful at wheeling your horses round the post, [310] but the horses themselves are
            very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other drivers know
            less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; <seg rend="subscript">313</seg> Come,
              my <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>, put in your <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign> every sort of skill [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>], <seg
              rend="subscript">314</seg> so that prizes may not elude you. [315] It is with <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign> rather than force [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >biē</foreign>] that a woodcutter is better. <seg rend="subscript">316</seg> It is
              with <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign> that a helmsman [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">kubernētēs</foreign>] over the wine-dark sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >pontos</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">317</seg> steers his swift ship buffeted by
              winds. <seg rend="subscript">318</seg> It is with <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >mētis</foreign> that charioteer is better than charioteer. [320] If a man go wide in
            rounding this way and that, whereas a man of craft [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kerdos</foreign>] may have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he
            sees the turning-post [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">terma</foreign>]; he knows the precise
            moment [325] at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of
              him. <seg rend="subscript">326</seg> I [= Nestor] will tell you [= Antilokhos] a sign
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], a very clear one, which will not get lost
            in your thinking. <seg rend="subscript">327</seg>Standing over there is a stump of
            deadwood, a good reach above ground level. <seg rend="subscript">328</seg> It had been
            either an oak or a pine. And it hasn’t rotted away from the rains. <seg rend="subscript"
              >329</seg> There are two white rocks propped against either side of it. [330] There it
            is, standing at a point where two roadways meet, and it has a smooth track on both sides
            of it for driving a chariot. <seg rend="subscript">331</seg> It is either the tomb
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of some mortal who died a long time ago <seg
              rend="subscript">332</seg> or was a turning point [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >nussa</foreign>] in the times of earlier men. <seg rend="subscript">333</seg> Now
            swift-footed radiant Achilles has set it up as a turning point [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >terma</foreign> plural]. <seg rend="subscript">334</seg> Get as close to it as you
            can when you drive your chariot horses toward it, [335] and keep leaning toward one side
            as you stand on the platform of your well-built chariot, <seg rend="subscript"
            >336</seg> leaning to the left as you drive your horses. Your right-side horse <seg
              rend="subscript">337</seg> you must goad, calling out to it, and give that horse some
            slack as you hold its reins, <seg rend="subscript">338</seg> while you make your
            left-side horse get as close as possible [to the turning point], <seg rend="subscript"
              >339</seg> so that the hub will seem to be almost grazing the post [340]—the hub of
            your well-made chariot wheel. But be careful not to touch the stone [of the turning
              point], <seg rend="subscript">341</seg> or else you will get your horses hurt badly
            and break your chariot in pieces. <seg rend="subscript">342</seg> That would make other
            people happy, but for you it would be a shame, <seg rend="subscript">343</seg> yes it
            would. So, near and dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] as you are to me,
            you must be sound in your thinking and be careful, for if you can be first to round the
            post [345] there is no chance of anyone giving you the go-by later, not even though he
            had Arion, the horse of Adrastos, a horse which is of divine race, or the horses of
            Laomedon, which are the noblest in this land.” </p>
          <p>When Nestor had made an end of counseling his son [350] he sat down in his place, and
            fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then all mounted their chariots and
            cast lots. Achilles shook the helmet, and the lot of Antilokhos, son of Nestor, fell out
            first; next came that of strong King Eumelos, [355] and after his, those of Menelaos the
            spear-famed son of Atreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomedes,
            son of Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places in line;
            Achilles showed them the turning-post round which they were to turn, some way off upon
            the plain; here he stationed his father’s follower [360] Phoenix as umpire, to note the
            running, and report truly. </p>
          <p>At the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them with the reins,
            and shouted at them with all their might. They flew full speed over the plain [365] away
            from the ships, the dust rose from under them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their
            manes were all flying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the
            ground, and then again they bounded into the air; [370] the drivers stood erect, and
            their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. Each kept calling on his
            horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds of dust that they raised. </p>
          <p>It was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way back towards the
            sea that their pace was strained to the utmost [375] and it was seen what each could do
            in striving [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] toward the prize. The horses of
            the descendant of Pheres now took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan
            stallions of Diomedes. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelos’ chariot, [380] and he
            could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads
            were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomedes would have now passed him, or
            there would have been a dead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his
            whip. [385] Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than
            ever, while his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Athena saw the trick
            which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, [390] so she brought him his whip and put
            spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son of Admetos in a rage and broke
            his yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and the other to the other,
            and the pole was broken against the ground. [395] Eumelos was thrown from his chariot
            close to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was
            bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance.
            But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shot far ahead, [400] for Athena put
            fresh strength into them and covered Diomedes himself with glory. </p>
          <p>Fair-haired Menelaos, son of Atreus, came next behind him, but battle-stubborn
            Antilokhos called to his father’s horses. “On with you both,” he cried, “and do your
            very utmost. I do not bid you try to beat [405] the steeds of the son of Tydeus, for
            Athena has put running into them, and has covered Diomedes with glory; but you must
            overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so
            fleet will taunt you. Why, my good men, are you lagging? [410] I tell you, and it shall
            surely be—Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we
            win any the worse a prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] through your
            carelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; [415] I will hit on a plan for
            passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not fail me.” </p>
          <p>They feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went quicker. Presently
            Antilokhos saw a narrow place where the road had sunk. [420] The ground was broken, for
            the winter’s rain had gathered and had worn the road so that the whole place was
            deepened. Menelaos was making towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul,
            but Antilokhos turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one side.
            [425] The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, “Antilokhos, you are driving
            recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and
            you can pass me then; if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a
            mischief.” </p>
          <p>But Antilokhos plied his whip, [430] and drove faster, as though he had not heard him.
            They went side by side for about as far as a young man can hurl a disc from his shoulder
            when he is trying his strength, and then Menelaos’ mares drew behind, for he left off
            driving [435] for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus,
            while pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the ground.
            Menelaos then upbraided Antilokhos and said, “There is no greater trickster living than
            you are; go, and bad luck go with you; [440] the Achaeans say not well that you have
            understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prize [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] without sworn protest on my part.” </p>
          <p>Then he called on his horses and said to them, “Keep your pace, and slacken not; [445]
            the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than yours, for they are neither of them
            young.” </p>
          <p>The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that they were soon
            nearly up with the others. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses went, as they
            scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust. [450] Idomeneus leader of the Cretans
            was first to make out the running, for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood
            on the most commanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off from the
            assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>], but Idomeneus could hear him
            shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly— [455] a chestnut with a round
            white mark [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>], like the moon, on its forehead. He
            stood up and said among the Argives, “My friends, princes and counselors of the Argives,
            can you see the running as well as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now,
            [460] and another driver; those that led off at the start must have been disabled out on
            the plain. I saw them at first making their way round the turning-post, but now, though
            I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. [465] Perhaps the reins fell from the
            driver’s hand so that he lost command of his horses at the turning-post, and could not
            turn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his
            mares have left the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for
            yourselves, [470] I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by
            descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomedes the son of Tydeus, breaker of
            horses.” </p>
          <p>Swift Ajax, the son of Oïleus, took him up rudely and said, “Idomeneus, why should you
            be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, [475] when the mares are still so far out
            upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but
            you are always laying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there are better men
            here than you are. [480] Eumelos’ horses are in front now, as they always have been, and
            he is on the chariot holding the reins.” </p>
          <p>The leader of the Cretans was angry, and answered, “Ajax, you are an excellent railer,
            but you have no judgment [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>], and are wanting in
            much else as well, for you have a vile temper. [485] I will wager you a tripod or
            cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are first. You will then
            know to your cost.” </p>
          <p>Swift Ajax son of Oïleus was for making him an angry answer, [490] and there would have
            been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen in his place and said,
            “Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus—it is not seemly; you would be scandalized if you
            saw anyone else do the like: [495] sit down in the assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>] and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards the
            winning-post and will be here directly. You will then both of you know whose horses are
            first, and whose come after.”</p>
          <p>[500] As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip lustily
            from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew over the course. The sand
            and grit rained thick on the driver, and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close
            behind his fleet horses. [505] There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust,
            and the horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomedes stayed them in the middle
            of the assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>], and the sweat from their
            manes and chests fell in streams on to the ground. <seg rend="subscript">509</seg> He
            [Diomedes] jumped from the splendid chariot to the ground [510] and leaned his whip
            against the yoke. Nor was he idle, <seg rend="subscript">511</seg> that powerful
            Sthenelos. He quickly took hold of the prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aethlon</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">512</seg> and he gave [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">dōke</foreign>] over to the superb companions, for taking away
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agein</foreign>], the woman, <seg rend="subscript"
            >513</seg> and the tripod with a handle [he gave it over to them] for carrying away
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pherein</foreign>]. Then he [Sthenelos] unharnessed the
            horses.</p>
          <p>Next after him came in Antilokhos of the race of Neleus, [515] who had passed Menelaos
            by craft [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>] and not by the fleetness of his
            horses; but even so Menelaos came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse
            that draws both the chariot and its master. [520] The end hairs of a horse’s tail touch
            the tire of the wheel, and there is never much space between wheel and horse when the
            chariot is going; Menelaos was no further than this behind Antilokhos, the blameless,
            though at first he had been a full disc’s throw behind him. He had soon caught him up
            again, for Agamemnon’s mare, Aethe [525] of the fair mane, kept pulling stronger and
            stronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passed him, and there
            would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus’ brave attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] Meriones was about a spear’s cast behind glorious
            Menelaos. [530] His horses were slowest of all in the contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>], and he was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of
            Admetos, dragging his chariot and driving his horses on in front. When radiant
            swift-footed Achilles saw him he was sorry, [535] and stood up among the Argives saying,
            “The best man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall
            have the second, but the first must go to the son of Tydeus.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak [540] and the others all of them applauded his saying, and were for
            doing as he had said, but great-hearted Nestor’s son Antilokhos stood up and claimed his
            rights from the son of Peleus. “Achilles,” said he, “I shall take it much amiss if you
            do this thing; you would rob me of my prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>],
            [545] because you think Eumelos’ chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too,
            good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come
            in last if he had done so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in
            your tents, with bronze, [550] sheep, cattle, and horses. Take something from this store
            if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] even than that which you have now offered; but I
            will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.”</p>
          <p>[555] Swift-footed Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilokhos,
            who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said, “Antilokhos, if you would have me find
            Eumelos another prize, [560] I will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin
            running all round it which I took from Asteropaios. It will be worth much money to
            him.” </p>
          <p>He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and he did so.
            Achilles [565] then gave it over to Eumelos, who received it gladly. </p>
          <p>But Menelaos got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilokhos. An attendant placed his
            staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep silence: the hero then addressed them.
            [570] “Antilokhos,” said he, “what is this from you who have been so far blameless? You
            have shamed my excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] and blocked my
            horses by flinging your own in front of them, though yours are much worse than mine are;
            therefore, O princes and counselors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favor,
            [575] lest one of the bronze-armored Achaeans say, ‘Menelaos has got the mare through
            lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilokhos’, but he is superior in
            excellence [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aretē</foreign>] and force [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>].’ No, I will determine the matter myself, and no man
            will blame me, for I shall do what is just. [580] Come here, Antilokhos, and stand, as
            our custom [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>] is, whip in hand before your
            chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, [585] and swear by earth-encircling
            Poseidon that you did not purposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses.” </p>
          <p>And Antilokhos answered, “Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaos, than you are;
            you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the two; you know how easily young
            men are betrayed into indiscretion; [590] their minds [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign>] are more hasty, but their cunning intelligence [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">mētis</foreign>] is slight; make due allowances therefore, and bear
            with me; I will of my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claim any
            further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once, [595]
            than fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the eyes of superhuman
            forces [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">daimones</foreign>].”</p>
          <p>The son of Nestor the great-hearted then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaos,
            whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of ripening wheat, and the
            lands are bristling with the harvest— [600] even so, O Menelaos, was your heart made
            glad within you. He turned to Antilokhos and said, “Now, Antilokhos, angry though I have
            been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor
            ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of your judgment
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]; [605] be careful how you outwit your
            betters in the future; no one else could have brought me round so easily, but your good
            father, your brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I
            therefore yield to your entreaty, [610] and will give up the mare to you, mine though it
            indeed be; the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive.” </p>
          <p>With this he gave the mare over to Antilokhos’ comrade Noemon, and then took the
            cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, [615] carried off the two talents of gold,
            and the fifth prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>], the two-handled urn,
            being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him in the assembly [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] of Argives and saying, “Take this, my good old friend,
            as an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroklos— [620] for you shall see him no
            more among the Argives. I give you this prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
            >āthlon</foreign>] though you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and
            cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid
            heavily upon you.”</p>
          <p>[625] So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and answered,
            “My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength now in my legs and feet,
            nor can I hit out with my hands from either shoulder. [630] Would that I were still
            young and strong as when the Epeioi were burying great King Amarynkeus in Bouprasion,
            and his sons offered prizes in his honor. There was then none that could vie with me
            neither of the Epeioi nor the Pylians themselves nor the great-hearted Aetolians. In
            boxing I overcame Klytomedes son of Enops, [635] and in wrestling, Ankaios of Pleuron
            who had come forward against me. Iphiklos was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw
            farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydoros. In chariot-racing alone did the
            two sons of Aktor surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me, for they were
            angry at the way victory had gone, [640] and at the greater part of the prizes remaining
            in the place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept on
            holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such was I
            then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; [645] I must bow before the
            weight of years, but in those days I was eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with
            the funeral contests [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthloi</foreign>] in honor of your
            comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart rejoices that you do not forget me
            but are ever mindful of my gentleness towards you, and of the respect [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] due to me from the Achaeans. [650] For all which may
            the grace [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kharis</foreign>] of heaven be granted you in great
            abundance.” </p>
          <p>Then the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the praise [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ainos</foreign>] of Nestor, went about among the concourse of the
            Achaeans, and presently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He
            brought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>]— [655] a she-mule never yet broken, but six years
            old—when it is hardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for the
            vanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives, “Son of
            Atreus, and all other strong-greaved Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers [660] to
            lay about them lustily and compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo grants the
            greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back
            with him to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double cup.”</p>
          <p>[665] As he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great stature, a skillful
            boxer, Epeios, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule and said, “Let the man who
            is to have the cup come here, for none but myself will take the mule. I am the best
            boxer of all here present, and none can beat me. [670] Is it not enough that I should
            fall short of you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell
            you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with me I will bruise his body
            and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in a body [675] and be at hand
            to take him away when I have done with him.” </p>
          <p>They all held their peace, and no man rose save godlike Euryalos, son of Mekisteus, who
            was son of Talaos. Mekisteus went once to Thebes after the fall of Oedipus, [680] to
            attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Kadmos. The spear-famed son of Tydeus
            was Euryalos’ second, cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he
            put a waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; [685]
            the two men being now girt went into the middle of the ring of competition [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>], and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they
            punish one another and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could hear the horrid
            crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeios
            came on and gave Euryalos a blow on the jaw [690] as he was looking round; Euryalos
            could not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a
            bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack,
            when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls back into deep water. But
            great-hearted [695] Epeios caught hold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came
            round him and led him from the ring of competition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>], unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting
            great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to fetch the double
            cup.</p>
          <p>[700] The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest and showed
            them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of wrestling. For the winner there
            was a great tripod ready for setting upon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among
            themselves at twelve oxen. For the loser he brought out [705] a woman skilled in all
            manner of arts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the Argives,
            “Stand forward, you who will essay this contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >āthlos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>Right then and there stood up great Ajax, the son of Telamon, and crafty Odysseus, full
            of craft [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">kerdos</foreign>] rose also. [710] The two girded
            themselves and went into the middle of the ring of competition [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>]. They gripped each other in their strong hands like the rafters which
            some master-builder frames for the roof of a high house to keep the wind out. [715]
            Their backbones cracked as they tugged at one another with their mighty arms—and sweat
            rained from them in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders,
            but they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to win the tripod.
            Odysseus could not throw Ajax, [720] nor Ajax him; Odysseus was too strong for him; but
            when the strong-greaved Achaeans began to tire of watching them, Ajax said to Odysseus,
            “Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, you shall either lift me, or I you, and let
            Zeus settle it between us.”</p>
          <p>[725] He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Odysseus did not forget his
            cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that he could not keep his
            feet, but fell on his back with Odysseus lying upon his chest, and all who saw it
            marveled. Then radiant much-enduring Odysseus in turn lifted Ajax [730] and stirred him
            a little from the ground but could not lift him right off it, his knee sank under him,
            and the two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now
            sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose
            and stayed them. [735] “Put not each other further,” said he, “to such cruel suffering;
            the victory is with both alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the other
            Achaeans now compete.” </p>
          <p>Thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their khitons again
            after wiping the dust from off their bodies.</p>
          <p>[740] The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running—a mixing-bowl
            beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six measures, and far exceeded all
            others in the whole world for beauty; it was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon,
            [745] and had been brought into port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>], who had made a present of it to Thoas. Eueneus son
            of Jason had given it to Patroklos in ransom of Priam’s son Lykaon, and Achilles now
            offered it as a prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] in honor of his
            comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. [750] For the second prize he offered
            a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there was to be half a talent of gold. He
            then rose and said among the Argives, “Stand forward, you who will essay this contest
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlos</foreign>].” </p>
          <p>Right then and there stood up swift Ajax son of Oïleus, [755] with cunning Odysseus,
            and Nestor’s son Antilokhos, the fastest runner among all the youth of his time. They
            stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The course was set out for them
            from the starting-post, and the son of Oïleus took the lead at once, [760] with radiant
            Odysseus as close behind him as the shuttle is to a woman’s bosom when she throws the
            woof across the warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was great
            Odysseus—treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there, [765] and Ajax
            could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly on. The Achaeans all
            shouted approval as they saw him straining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past
            them; but when they were now nearing the end of the course Odysseus prayed inwardly to
            owl-vision Athena. [770] “Hear me,” he cried, “and help my feet, O goddess.” Thus did he
            pray, and Pallas Athena heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet feel light,
            and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the prize [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>], Ajax, through Athena’s spite slipped [775] upon
            some manure that was lying around from the cattle which swift-footed Achilles had
            slaughtered in honor of Patroklos, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow
            dung. Odysseus therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before glorious Ajax
            and came in first. [780] But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one of its
            horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, “Alas, the
            goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over Odysseus and stands by him as though
            she were his own mother.” Thus did he speak and they all of them laughed heartily. </p>
          <p>[785] Antilokhos carried off the last prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>]
            and smiled as he said to the bystanders, “You all see, my friends, that now too the gods
            have shown their respect for seniority. [790] Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as
            for Odysseus, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of his years,
            and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save only Achilles.” </p>
          <p>He said this to pay a compliment to the swift-footed son of Peleus, and Achilles
            answered, [795] “Antilokhos, you shall not have given me praise [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">ainos</foreign>] to no purpose; I shall give you an additional half
            talent of gold.” He then gave the half talent to Antilokhos, who received it
            gladly. </p>
          <p>Then the son of Peleus brought out to the assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>] the spear, helmet, and shield [800] that had been borne by Sarpedon,
            and were taken from him by Patroklos. He stood up and said among the Argives, “We bid
            two champions put on their armor, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another
            in the presence of the multitude; [805] whichever of them can first wound the flesh of
            the other, cut through his armor, and draw blood, to him will I give this goodly
            Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I took from Asteropaios, but the armor let both
            hold in partnership, [810] and I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own
            tent.” </p>
          <p>Right then and there stood up great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomedes,
            son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armor each on his own side of the ring, they
            both went into the middle eager to engage, [815] and with fire flashing from their eyes.
            The Achaeans marveled as they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with one
            another, three times did they spring forward and three times try to strike each other in
            close combat. Ajax pierced Diomedes’ round shield, but did not draw blood, for the
            cuirass beneath the shield protected him; [820] then the son of Tydeus from over his
            huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax’s neck with the point of his spear, and the
            Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting and divide the prize
            between them. Achilles then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, [825] with its
            scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it.</p>
          <p>Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eëtion had once upon a time
            been used to hurl, until swift-footed radiant Achilles had slain him and carried it off
            in his ships along with other spoils. [830] He stood up and said among the Argives,
            “Stand forward, you who would essay this contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >āthlos</foreign>]. He who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five
            years as they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his shepherd
            or ploughman [835] will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for he will have a stock
            of it on his own premises.” </p>
          <p>Then stood up the two mighty men Polypoites and Leonteus, with Ajax, son of Telamon,
            and noble Epeios. They stood up one after the other and Epeios took the quoit, [840]
            whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw
            Leonteus of the race of Arēs. Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, threw third, and sent the
            quoit beyond any mark [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] that had been made yet,
            but when mighty Polypoites took the quoit he hurled it as though it had been a
            stockman’s stick which he sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them,
            [845] so far did his throw out-distance those of the others in the contest [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>]. All who saw it roared approval, and his comrades
            carried the prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] for him and set it on
            board his ship.</p>
          <p>[850] Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery—ten double-edged axes and ten
            with single eddies: he set up a ship’s mast, some way off upon the sands, and with a
            fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. [855]
            “Whoever,” he said, “can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with
            him; he who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and
            shall have the single-edged axes.”</p>
          <p>Then stood up King Teucer, [860] and Meriones the stalwart attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of Idomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze
            helmet and the lot of Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow right then and there,
            but he did not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, [865] and missed his
            bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was tied,
            near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it hung down towards the
            ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted approval. [870]
            Meriones, who had his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his
            hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to
            Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the clouds, [875] he hit
            her in the middle of the wing as she was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through
            the wing and fixed itself in the ground at Meriones’ feet, but the bird perched on the
            ship’s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; [880] the life went out
            of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten
            double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones to his ships. </p>
          <p>Then the son of Peleus brought in to the contest [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >agōn</foreign>] [885] a spear and a cauldron that had never been on the fire; it was
            worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin
            stood up—to wit the son of Atreus, wide-powerful king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones,
            stalwart attendant of Idomeneus. But swift-footed radiant Achilles spoke saying, [890]
            “Son of Atreus, we know how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the
            javelin; take the cauldron as prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] back
            with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this
            at least is what I should myself wish.”</p>
          <p>[895] King Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and handed the
            goodly cauldron as prize [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">āthlon</foreign>] to Talthybios his
            attendant. </p>

          <head>Rhapsody 24</head>
          <p rend="no-indent">[1] The assembly [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">agōn</foreign>] now broke
            up and the people went their ways each to his own ship. There they made ready their
            supper, and then turned their thoughts to the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still
            wept for thinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, [5] before whom all things bow, could
            take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned after the might and
            manfulness of Patroklos; he thought of all they had done together, and all they had gone
            through both on the field of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on
            these things he wept bitterly [10] and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now
            face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught to wander upon the
            seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his
            chariot, [15] and bound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice
            did he drag it round the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of the son of
            Menoitios, and then went back into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length
            and with its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for he
            pitied the man, dead though he now was; [20] therefore he shielded him with his golden
            aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while Achilles was dragging him. </p>
          <p>Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonor great Hector; but the blessed gods
            looked down in pity from heaven, and urged clear-sighted Hermes, slayer of Argos, to
            steal the body. [25] All were of this mind save only Hera, Poseidon, and Zeus’
            owl-vision daughter, who persisted in the hate which they had ever borne towards Ilion
            with Priam and his people; for they forgave not the wrong [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >atē</foreign>] done them by Alexandros <seg rend="subscript">29</seg> who blamed
              [made <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">neikos</foreign> against] the goddesses [Hera and
            Athena], when they came to his courtyard, [30] but he praised her [Aphrodite] who gave
            him the baneful pleasure of sex. </p>
          <p>When the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus Apollo spoke among the
            immortals saying, “You gods ought to be ashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and
            hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats?
            [35] And now dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his
            mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would right then and there
            commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you would all be
            on the side of mad Achilles? [40] His thinking [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >phrenes</foreign>] is not right and his sense of <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >noos</foreign> <seg rend="subscript">41</seg> is not flexible within his breast, but
            like a lion he knows savage ways. <seg rend="subscript">42</seg> —a lion that yields to
            its strength [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">biē</foreign>] and overweening <foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">thūmos</foreign>, <seg rend="subscript">43</seg> and goes after the
            sheep of men, in order to get a feast [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dais</foreign>].  Even
            so has Achilles flung aside all pity, [45] and all that decency [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] which at once so greatly hurts yet greatly benefits
            anyone who abides by it. <seg rend="subscript">46</seg> For a man could easily lose
            someone else who is more <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">phílos</foreign>, <seg
              rend="subscript">47</seg> either a brother from the same womb or even a son;  yet when
            he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes much sorrow to
            kill a man; [50] whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble Hector, drags him behind
            his chariot round the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of his comrade. It
            were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave though he be we
            gods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.”</p>
          <p>[55] Hera of the white arms spoke up in a rage. “This were well,” she cried, “O lord of
            the silver bow, if you would give like honor [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>]
            to Hector and to Achilles; but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman’s breast,
            whereas Achilles is the offspring of a goddess [60] whom I myself reared and brought up.
            I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals; <seg
              rend="subscript">62</seg> and all you gods attended the wedding. And you too were
            feasting among them <seg rend="subscript">63</seg> and you had your lyre with
            you— false, and fond of low company, that you have ever been.” </p>
          <p>Then said Zeus, who gathers the clouds, [65] “Hera, be not so bitter. Their honor
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">tīmē</foreign>] shall not be equal, but of all that dwell in
            Ilion, Hector was dearest to the gods, as also to myself, for his offerings never failed
            me. Never was my altar stinted of its dues, [70] nor of the drink-offerings and savor of
            sacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body of mighty Hector to
            be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without Achilles coming to know it, for his mother
            keeps night and day beside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, [75]
            and I will impart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom from
            Priam, and give up the body.” </p>
          <p>Then Iris, fleet as the wind, went forth to carry his message. [80] Down she plunged
            into the dark sea [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pontos</foreign>] midway between Samos and
            rocky Imbros; the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom as
            the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death to fishes. She found
            Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other sea-goddesses gathered round her; [85]
            there she sat in the midst of them weeping for her noble son who was to fall far from
            his own land, on the fertile plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, <seg
              rend="subscript">88</seg> “Bestir yourself, Thetis! Zeus, skilled in imperishable
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aphthita</foreign>] counsels, is calling you” <seg
              rend="subscript">89</seg> And Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, answered, [90] “Why
            has that great god summoned me? <seg rend="subscript">91</seg> I am shy to have
            intercourse with the immortals and I am in great grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >akhos</foreign>]. Still, I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be
            spoken in vain.” </p>
          <p>The goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more somber, [95] and
            went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. The waves of the sea opened them
            a path, and when they reached the shore they flew up into the heavens, where they found
            the all-seeing son of Kronos of the wide brows with the blessed gods that live for ever
            assembled near him. Athena gave up her seat to her, [100] and she sat down by the side
            of father Zeus. Hera then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to her in
            words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup; and the sire of gods
            and men was the first to speak. </p>
          <p>“So, goddess Thetis,” said he, [105] “for all your sorrow, and the grief [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] that I well know reigns ever in your heart, you
            have come here to Olympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days
            past the immortals have been quarreling about Achilles, waster of cities, and the body
            of Hector. The gods would have clear-sighted Hermes, slayer of Argos, steal the body,
            but in furtherance of our decency [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">aidōs</foreign>] and sense
            of being near-and-dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philotēs</foreign>] henceforward, [110]
            I will concede such honor to your son as I will now tell you. Go, then, to the army and
            lay these commands upon him; say that the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself
            more angry than them all, [115] in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give
            him up. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will send Iris to
            great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and ransom his son, taking with
            him such gifts for Achilles as may give him satisfaction.</p>
          <p>[120] Silver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and right away she darted down
            from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son’s tents where she found him
            grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades round him were busy preparing their morning
            meal, [125] for which they had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside
            him and caressed him with her hand saying, “My son, how long will you keep on thus
            grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, [130] and think neither of
            food nor of woman’s embraces; and yet these too were well, for you have no long time to
            live, and death with the strong hand of fate are already close beside you. Now,
            therefore, heed what I say, for I come as a messenger from Zeus; he says that the gods
            are angry with you, [135] and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep Hector
            at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him go, and accept a ransom for his
            body.” </p>
          <p>And Achilles of the swift feet answered, “So be it. [140] If Olympian Zeus of his own
            motion thus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.” </p>
          <p>Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse with one another.
            Meanwhile the son of Kronos sent Iris to the strong city of Ilion. “Go,” said he, “fleet
            Iris, from the mansions of Olympus, [145] and tell King Priam in Ilion that he is to go
            to the ships of the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts
            with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone, with no other
            Trojan, save only some honored servant [150] who may drive his mules and wagon, and
            bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor
            fear of death in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argos to escort him, [155]
            and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another do
            so, for he will take heed to his ways and err not, and he will entreat a suppliant with
            all honorable courtesy.” </p>
          <p>Then Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. [160] She went to
            Priam’s house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. His sons were seated round
            their father in the outer courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old man
            sat in the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and
            neck all covered with the filth [165] which he had clutched as he lay groveling in the
            mire. His daughters and his sons’ wives went wailing about the house, as they thought of
            the many and brave men who lost their life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >psūkhē</foreign>], slain by the Argives. The messenger of Zeus stood by Priam [170]
            and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. “Take heart,” she said,
            “Priam, offspring of Dardanos, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am
            minded well towards you. I come as a messenger from Zeus, who though he be not near,
            takes thought for you and pities you. [175] The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom
            noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. You
            are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honored servant who may drive your mules
            and wagon, and bring back to the city [180] the body of him whom noble Achilles has
            slain. You are to have no thought nor fear of death, for Zeus will send the slayer of
            Argos to escort you. When he has brought you within Achilles’ tent, [185] Achilles will
            not kill you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and err not, and
            he will treat a suppliant with all honorable courtesy.” </p>
          <p>Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons to get a mule-wagon
            ready, [190] and to make the body of the wagon fast upon the top of its bed. Then he
            went down into his fragrant store-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his
            many treasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. “Wife,” said he, “a messenger
            has come to me from Olympus, [195] and has told me to go to the ships of the Achaeans to
            ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles.
            What think you of this matter? for my own part greatly does the power [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">menos</foreign>] of my heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>] bid me to go there through the broad camp of the Achaeans to their
            ships.”</p>
          <p>[200] His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, “Alas, what has become of that
            judgment for which you have been ever famous both among strangers and your own people?
            How can you venture alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him
            who has slain so many of your [205] brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the
            cruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let
            us then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, [210] for when I gave him birth the
            threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far from his
            parents, in the house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour
            it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and
            thought neither of Right nor of avoiding battle [215] as he stood in defense of Trojan
            men and Trojan women.” </p>
          <p>Then Priam the godlike said, “I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a bird of
            ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. [220] Had it been some mortal man who
            had sent me some seer [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">mantis</foreign>] or priest who divines
            from sacrifice—I should have deemed him false and have given him no heed; but now I have
            heard the goddess and seen her face to face, therefore I will go and her saying shall
            not be in vain. [225] If it be my fate to die at the ships of the bronze-armored
            Achaeans even so would I have it; let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my
            son in my arms and mourned him to my heart’s comforting.” </p>
          <p>So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly vestments. He
            took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, [230] twelve fair mantles, and an
            equal number of khitons. He weighed out ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two
            burnished tripods, four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had
            given him when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, [235] but he
            grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son. Then he chased all
            the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with words of anger. “Out,” he cried, “shame
            and disgrace to me that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come
            to plague me here? [240] Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Kronos has sent
            this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? I tell you, you shall prove it in
            person, for now that he is gone the Achaeans will have easier work in killing you. As
            for me, let me go down within the house of Hādēs, [245] before my eyes behold the
            ransacking and wasting of the city.” </p>
          <p>He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old man sped them.
            Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenos, Paris, noble Agathon, [250] Pammon,
            Antiphonos, Polites of the loud battle-cry, Deiphobos, Hippothoös, and proud Dios. These
            nine did the old man call near him. “Come to me at once,” he cried, “worthless sons who
            do me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector. [255]
            Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy—noble godlike Mestor,
            Troilus, the dauntless charioteer, and <seg rend="subscript">258</seg> Hector, who was a
            god among men; and he seemed <seg rend="subscript">259</seg> to be the child not of a
            mortal but of a god —yet there is not one of them left. [260] Arēs has slain them and
            those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes of the
            dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people, why do you not get a wagon ready
            for me at once, and put all these things upon it that I may set out on my way?”</p>
          <p>[265] Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They brought out a
            strong mule-wagon, newly made, and set the body of the wagon fast on its bed. They took
            the mule-yoke from the peg on which it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of
            it and rings for the reins to go through. [270] Then they brought a yoke-band eleven
            cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of the pole,
            and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast with three turns of the band on
            either side the knob, and bending the thong of the yoke beneath it. [275] This done,
            they brought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase the body of
            Hector, and they set it all orderly on the wagon; then they yoked the strong
            harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but
            for Priam himself they yoked horses [280] which the old king had bred, and kept for own
            use. </p>
          <p>Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yoking of their cars at the palace.
            Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, [285] with a golden goblet of wine in her right
            hand, that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of
            the horses and said, “Take this, make a drink-offering to father Zeus, and since you are
            minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back from the
            hands of your enemies. [290] Pray to the son of Kronos, lord of the whirlwind, who sits
            on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right
            hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you
            may see it with your own eyes [295] and trust it as you go forth to the ships of the
            fast-mounted Danaans. If all-seeing Zeus will not send you this messenger, however set
            upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships of the Argives.” </p>
          <p>And Priam the godlike answered, [300] “Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to
            lift hands in prayer to Zeus, if so be he may have mercy upon me.” With this the old man
            bade the serving-woman pour pure water over his hands, and the woman came, bearing the
            water in a bowl. [305] He washed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made
            the drink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his
            eyes to heaven. “Father Zeus,” he said, “you who rule from Ida, most glorious and most
            great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of Achilles;
            and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, [310] the bird of omen which is
            strongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and
            trust it as I go forth to the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans.” </p>
          <p>So did he pray, and Zeus, the lord of counsel, heard his prayer. [315] Right then and
            there he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that fly, the dusky
            hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were spread abroad on either side
            as wide as the well-made and well-bolted door of a rich man’s chamber. [320] He came to
            them flying over the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad
            and their hearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to mount his chariot,
            and drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer
            court. Before him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled wagon, [325] and driven by
            high-spirited Idaios; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed with his
            whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and
            lamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they had come down
            from the city and had reached the plain, [330] his sons and sons-in-law who had followed
            him went back to Ilion.</p>
          <p>But Priam and Idaios as they showed out upon the plain did not escape the ken of
            all-seeing Zeus of the wide brows, who looked down upon the old man and pitied him; then
            he spoke to his beloved son Hermes and said, “Hermes, [335] for it is you who are the
            most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and
            so conduct Priam to the ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him
            nor take note of him until he reach the son of Peleus.” Thus he spoke and strong Hermes,
            guide and guardian, slayer of Argos, did as he was told. [340] Right then and there he
            bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land
            and sea; he took the wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as
            he pleases, [345] and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to the
            Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in the hey-day of his
            youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face. </p>
          <p>Now when Priam and Idaios had driven past the great tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign>] of Ilion, [350] they stayed their mules and horses that they might
            drink in the river, for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaios saw
            Hermes standing near them he said to Priam, “Take heed, descendant of Dardanos; here is
            matter which demands consideration [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>]. [355] I
            see a man who I think will presently fall upon us; let us flee with our horses, or at
            least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?” </p>
          <p>When he heard this the old man’s mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] failed
            him, and he was in great fear; [360] he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair
            stood on end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and took
            him by the hand, saying, “Where, father, are you thus driving your mules and horses in
            the dead of night when other men are asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans
            [365] who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you
            bearing so much treasure through the darkness of the fleeing night, what would not your
            state of mind [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] then be? You are no longer
            young, and he who is with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack you.
            [370] For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from anyone else, for you
            remind me of my own father.” </p>
          <p>And old Priam the godlike answered, “It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless
            some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer as yourself to
            meet me so opportunely; [375] you are so comely in mien and figure, and your judgment
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">noos</foreign>] is so excellent that you must come of
            blessed parents.” </p>
          <p>Then said the slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, “Sir, all that you have said is
            right; [380] but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this rich treasure to send it
            to a foreign people where it may be safe, or are you all leaving strong Ilion in dismay
            now that your son has fallen [385] who was the bravest man among you and was never
            lacking in battle with the Achaeans?” </p>
          <p>And Priam the godlike said, “Who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that you
            speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?” </p>
          <p>The slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, answered him, [390] “Sir, you would prove me,
            that you question me about glorious Hector. Many a time have I set eyes upon him in
            battle when he was driving the Argives to their ships and putting them to the sword. We
            stood still and marveled, [395] for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus
            suffered us not to fight. I am his attendant [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >therapōn</foreign>], and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon, and my
            father’s name is Polyktor: he is a rich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons
            besides myself, and I am the seventh. [400] We cast lots, and it fell upon me to sail
            here with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the
            glancing-eyed Achaeans will set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing
            nothing, and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back.”</p>
          <p>[405] Then answered Priam the godlike, “If you are indeed the attendant [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapōn</foreign>] of Achilles, son of Peleus, tell me now the whole
            truth. Is my son still at the ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given
            him to his hounds?”</p>
          <p>[410] “Sir,” replied the slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, “neither hounds nor
            vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the tents by the ship of
            Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he has lain there, his flesh is not
            wasted nor have the worms eaten him [415] although they feed on warriors. At daybreak
            Achilles drags him cruelly round the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] of
            his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies
            fresh as dew, with the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed
            [420] though many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken
            of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.” </p>
          <p>The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, [425] “My son, see what a good
            thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for as sure as that he was born
            my son never forgot the gods that hold Olympus, and now they requite it to him even in
            death. Accept therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; [430] guard me and with
            heaven’s help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.” </p>
          <p>Then answered the slayer of Argos, guide and guardian, “Sir, you are tempting me and
            playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, for you are offering me presents [435]
            without the knowledge of Achilles whom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud,
            lest some evil presently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to Argos
            itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one should
            attack you through making light of him who was with you.”</p>
          <p>[440] The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing the whip and
            reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. When they reached the trench
            and the wall that was before the ships, those who were on guard had just been getting
            their suppers, [445] and the slayer of Argos threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he
            drew back the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had
            upon his wagon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of Peleus [450] for
            which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built for their king; when they had
            built it they thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out on the
            plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set
            close together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine which it took three men
            to force into its place, [455] and three to draw back so as to open the gate, but
            Achilles could draw it by himself. Hermes opened the gate for the old man, and brought
            in the treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang from
            the chariot on to the ground and said, [460] “Sir, it is I, immortal Hermes, that am
            come with you, for my father sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and will not
            enter into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriend
            mortal men thus openly. [465] Go you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus:
            beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.” With
            these words Hermes went back to high Olympus. </p>
          <p>Priam sprang from his chariot to the ground, [470] leaving Idaios where he was, in
            charge of the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where Achilles,
            loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his men seated at a distance
            from him: only two, the hero Automedon, and Alkimos of the race of Arēs, were busy in
            attendance about his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, [475] and the
            table was still there. Tall King Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right
            up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread manslaughtering hands that had
            slain so many of his sons.</p>
          <p>[480] As when some cruel derangement [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">atē</foreign>] has
            befallen a man that he should have killed some one in his own country, and must flee to
            a great man’s protection in a land [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">dēmos</foreign>] of
            strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles marvel as he beheld godlike
            Priam. The others looked one to another and marveled also, [485] but Priam besought
            Achilles saying, <seg rend="subscript">486</seg> “Remember your father, O Achilles, you
            who look just like the gods. <seg rend="subscript">487</seg> He [= Peleus, the father of
            Achilles] is just like me, on the destructive threshold of old age. <seg
              rend="subscript">488</seg> It may be that those who dwell near him <seg
              rend="subscript">489</seg> are wearing him down, and there is no one to keep damage
            and devastation away from him. [490] Yet when he hears of you being still alive, <seg
              rend="subscript">491</seg> he takes pleasure in his heart [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thūmos</foreign>], and every day he is full of hope <seg rend="subscript"
            >492</seg>that he will see his dear [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">philos</foreign>] son come
            home to him from Troy; <seg rend="subscript">493</seg> but I am the most luckless of all
            men, since I fathered the best sons <seg rend="subscript">494</seg> in the city of Troy,
            which has power far and wide, and I can now say that there is not one of them left.
            [495] I had fifty sons when the sons of the Achaeans came here; <seg rend="subscript"
              >496</seg> nineteen of them were from a single womb, <seg rend="subscript"
            >497</seg> and the others were born to me by the women of my halls. <seg
              rend="subscript">498</seg> Many of them have been hamstrung by swift Arēs, <seg
              rend="subscript">499</seg> but he who was the only one left, who was the guardian of
            the city and ourselves, [500] he has been killed by you just now, while he was
            protecting his fatherland. <seg rend="subscript">501</seg> I mean Hector. And it is
            because of him that I now come to the ships of the Achaeans <seg rend="subscript"
              >502</seg> intending to ransom his body from you. And I bring with me great ransom
            beyond telling. <seg rend="subscript">503</seg> Show respect [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aideîsthai</foreign>], O Achilles, to the gods; and have pity on me. <seg
              rend="subscript">504</seg> Remember your own father. But I am far more pitiable, [505]
            for I have steeled myself as no one yet among earthbound mortals has ever steeled
            himself before me. <seg rend="subscript">506</seg> I have raised to my lips the hand of
            the one who killed my son.” </p>
          <p><seg rend="subscript">507</seg> Thus he [= Priam] spoke, and he stirred up in him [=
            Achilles] a longing to cry in lament [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">goos</foreign>] for his
            own father. <seg rend="subscript">508</seg> He touched the old man’s hand and moved him
            gently away. <seg rend="subscript">509</seg> And they both remembered. One of them
            remembered Hector the man-killer [510] and cried for him, shedding tears thick and fast
            as he lay near the feet of Achilles. <seg rend="subscript">511</seg> As for Achilles, he
            was crying for his own father at one moment, and then, at the very next moment, <seg
              rend="subscript">512</seg> he would be crying for Patroklos. And the sounds of lament
            rose up all over the dwelling. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and had
            unburdened the bitterness of his sorrow, [515] he left his seat and raised the old man
            by the hand, in pity for his white hair and beard; then he said, “Unhappy man, you have
            indeed been greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the
            Achaeans, [520] and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your brave sons?
            You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for all our grief we will hide
            our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care,
            [525] yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus’ palace
            there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He
            for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, [530] will meet now with
            good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be
            pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the
            world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor
            men. Even so did it befall Peleus; [535] the gods endowed him with all good things from
            his birth upwards, for he reigned over the Myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity
              [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">olbos</foreign>] and wealth, and mortal though he was they
            gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him too did heaven send misfortune, for
            there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, [540] save one son who is
            doomed to die all untimely [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">pan-a-(h)ō-rios</foreign> = ‘the
            most unseasonal of them all’]; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old,
            for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And you too, O
            Priam, I have heard that you were formerly happy [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >olbios</foreign>]. They say that in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed
            all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, [545] Phrygia that is more
            inland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the day when the
            dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter have been about your city
            continually. Bear up against it, and let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn
            as you may for your brave son, [550] you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him
            from the dead, before you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.” </p>
          <p>And Priam the godlike answered, “O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is still
            lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom which I have brought you,
            [555] and give him to me at once that I may look upon him. May you prosper with the
            ransom and reach your own land in safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and
            to look upon the light of the sun.”</p>
          <p>Swift-footed Achilles looked at him sternly and said, [560] “Vex me, sir, no longer; I
            am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter of the old man of
            the sea, came to me from Zeus to bid me deliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O
            Priam, and you cannot hide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the
            Achaeans, for else, [565] no man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to
            our army; he could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thus
            easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I err against the word of Zeus, and
            suffer you not, [570] suppliant though you are, within my tents.” </p>
          <p>The old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like a lion through
            the door of his house, not alone, but with him went his two attendants [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">therapontes</foreign>] Automedon and Alkimos [575] who were closer to
            him than any others of his comrades now that Patroklos was no more. These unyoked the
            horses and mules, and bade Priam’s herald and attendant be seated within the house. They
            lifted the ransom for Hector’s body from the wagon. [580] but they left two mantles and
            a goodly khiton, that Achilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken
            home. Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,
            but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it, [585] lest if he did so,
            he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then
            kill him and err against the word of Zeus. When the servants had washed the body and
            anointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair khiton and mantle, [590] Achilles himself
            lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the wagon. He cried aloud as
            he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, “Be not angry with me, Patroklos,”
            he said, “if you hear even in the house of Hādēs that I have given great Hector to his
            father for a ransom. It has been no unworthy one, [595] and I will share it equitably
            with you.” </p>
          <p>Great Achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly inlaid
            seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right angles to the one against
            which Priam was sitting. “Sir,” he said, [600] “your son is now laid upon his bier and
            is ransomed according to desire; you shall look upon him when you take him away at
              daybreak. <seg rend="subscript">601</seg> But now the two of us must think of
              eating. <seg rend="subscript">602</seg> Even Niobe, the one with the beautiful hair,
            thought of eating grain, <seg rend="subscript">603</seg> the one who had twelve
            children, and all of them were killed in the palace, <seg rend="subscript">604</seg> six
            daughters and six sons in the bloom of youth. [605] Apollo killed the sons, shooting
            from his silver bow. <seg rend="subscript">606</seg> He was angry at Niobe—and the
            daughters were killed by Artemis, shooter of arrows— <seg rend="subscript"
            >607</seg> angry because she [= Niobe] tried to make herself equal to Leto, the one with
            the beautiful cheeks. <seg rend="subscript">608</seg> She [= Niobe] said that she [=
            Leto] gave birth to two, while she herself produced many. <seg rend="subscript"
              >609</seg> So the two of them [= Apollo and Artemis], only two though they were,
            destroyed the many. [610] They [= the children of Niobe] lay there in their gore for
            nine days, and there was no one <seg rend="subscript">611</seg> to bury them. The people
            had been turned into stone by the son of Kronos. <seg rend="subscript">612</seg>. Then
            on the tenth day they [= the children of Niobe] were given a burial by the sky-dwelling
            gods themselves. <seg rend="subscript">613</seg> And she [= Niobe] thought of eating,
            since she was exhausted by her shedding of tears, <seg rend="subscript">614</seg> and
            now, somewhere amidst the rocks, on the desolate heights, [615] in Sipylos, where they
            say the goddesses have places to sleep <seg rend="subscript">616</seg> —the goddess
            nymphs, the ones who dance on the banks of the Akhelōios— <seg rend="subscript"
              >617</seg> there does she [= Niobe], though she has been turned into stone, digest her
            sorrows inflicted by the gods. <seg rend="subscript">618</seg> So too now the two of us
            must think, radiant old man, <seg rend="subscript">619</seg> of eating grain. And then,
            after that, for your dear child you may weep again, [620] after you have brought him to
            Troy. And there will be many tears shed for him.” </p>
          <p>With this fleet Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery whiteness,
            which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >kosmos</foreign>]. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them,
            and drew them off again when they were well roasted. [625] Automedon brought bread in
            fair baskets and served it round the table, <seg rend="subscript">626</seg> and Achilles
            distributed the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before
            them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanos,
            [630] marveled at the strength and beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to see, and
            Achilles marveled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble presence.
            When they had gazed their fill Priam the godlike spoke first. “And now, O king,” he
            said, [635] “take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of
            sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your hands took the life of my
            son; I have groveled without ceasing [640] in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan
            and brooding over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk
            wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing.” </p>
          <p>As he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds in the room that
            was in the gatehouse, [645] and make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on
            the top of them with woolen cloaks for Priam and Idaios to wear. So the maids went out
            carrying a torch and got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles of the swift
            feet said laughingly to Priam, [650] “Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some
            counselor of those who, as is right [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">themis</foreign>], keep
            coming to advise with me should see you here in the darkness of the fleeing night, and
            tell it to Agamemnon, shepherd of the people. [655] This might cause delay in the
            delivery of the body. And now tell me and tell me true, for how many days would you
            celebrate the funeral rites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and
            restrain the army.” </p>
          <p>And Priam the godlike answered, [660] “Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son
            with all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You know how we are pent
            up within our city; it is far for us to fetch wood from the mountain, and the people
            live in fear. Nine days, therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; [665] on the tenth
            day we will bury him and there shall be a public feast in his honor; on the eleventh we
            will build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, we will
            fight.” </p>
          <p>And swift-footed radiant Achilles answered, “All, King Priam, shall be as you have
            said. [670] I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.”</p>
          <p>As he spoke he laid his hand on the old man’s right wrist, in token that he should have
            no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of
            thought, [675] while Achilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Brisēis by
            his side. </p>
          <p>And now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong night, but upon
            Hermes alone, the bringer of good luck, [680] sleep could take no hold for he was
            thinking all the time how to get King Priam away from the ships without his being seen
            by the strong force of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam’s head and said, “Sir,
            now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about sleeping in the
            thick of your foes. [685] You have paid a great ransom, and have received the body of
            your son; were you still alive and a prisoner the sons whom you have left at home would
            have to give three times as much to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the
            other Achaeans were to know of your being here.”</p>
          <p>[690] When he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant. Hermes then
            yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly through the army so that no man
            perceived them. When they came to the ford of eddying Xanthos, begotten of immortal
            Zeus, Hermes went back to high Olympus, [695] and dawn in robe of saffron began to break
            over all the land. Priam and Idaios then drove on toward the city lamenting and making
            moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither man nor woman saw them, till
            Kassandra, fair as golden Aphrodite [700] standing on Pergamon, caught sight of her dear
            father in his chariot, and his servant that was the city’s herald with him. Then she saw
            him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went about
            the city saying, “Come here Trojans, men and women, and look on Hector; [705] if ever
            you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he was alive, look now on him that was
            the glory of our city and all our people.” </p>
          <p>At this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met
            Priam as he was bringing in the body. [710] Hector’s wife and his mother were the first
            to mourn him: they flew towards the wagon and laid their hands upon his head, while the
            crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before the gates, weeping and
            lamenting the livelong day to the going down of the sun, [715] had not Priam spoken to
            them from the chariot and said, “Make way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I
            have taken the body home you shall have your fill of weeping.” </p>
          <p>Then the people stood asunder, and made a way for the wagon. [720] When they had borne
            the body within the house they laid it upon a bed <seg rend="subscript">720</seg> and
            they seated next to him [Hektor’s corpse] singers [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >aoidoí</foreign>] <seg rend="subscript">721</seg> who were to lead in the
            lamentations [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">thrēnoi</foreign>]. They sang a wailing
              song, <seg rend="subscript">722</seg> singing <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >thrēnoi</foreign>. And the women wailed in response, <seg rend="subscript"
            >723</seg> and white-armed Andromache led them in the lamentation [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">goos</foreign>] as she clasped the head of mighty manslaughtering
            Hector in her embrace. [725] “Husband,” she cried, “you have died young, and leave me in
            your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is still a mere child, and
            I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown,
            for you who watched over it are no more— <seg rend="subscript">729</seg> you who guarded
            it [730] and you protected the cherished wives and helpless children. Our women will be
            carried away captives to the ships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be
            with me will be put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. [735] Or, may
            be, some Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to avenge some
            brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them have indeed bitten the dust at
            his hands, for your father’s hand in battle was no light one. [740] Therefore do the
            people mourn him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my
            own grief [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">penthos</foreign>] is greatest of all, for you did
            not stretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words
            that might have lived with me [745] in my tears night and day for evermore.” </p>
          <p>Bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament. Hecuba in her turn
            took up the strains of woe. “Hector,” she cried, “dearest to me of all my children. So
            long as you were alive the gods loved you well, [750] and even in death they have not
            been utterly unmindful of you; for when swift-footed Achilles took any other of my sons,
            he would sell him beyond the seas, to Samos, Imbros, or rugged Lemnos; and when he had
            taken away with his sword your life-breath [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">psūkhē</foreign>]
            as well, [755] many a time did he drag you round the tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >sēma</foreign>] of his comrade—though this could not give him life—yet here you lie
            all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts.”</p>
          <p>[760] Thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then Helen for a
            third time took up the strain of lamentation. “Hector,” said she, “dearest of all my
            brothers-in-law—for I am wife to Alexandros who brought me here to Troy—would that I had
            died before he did so— [765] twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and
            came from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness from
            you. When another would chide with me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters or
            of your brothers’ wives, [770] or my mother-in-law—for Priam was as kind to me as though
            he were my own father—you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and
            goodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no
            one else in Troy [775] who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by
            me.” </p>
          <p>She wept as she spoke and the vast local populace [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
              >dēmos</foreign>] that was gathered round her joined in her lament. Then King Priam
            spoke to them saying, “Bring wood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of
            the Argives, [780] for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his word
            that they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth day.” </p>
          <p>Right then and there they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before the
            city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps of wood, [785] and on the morning of
            the tenth day with many tears they took brave Hector forth, laid his dead body upon the
            summit of the pile, and set it on fire. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered
            dawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of
            illustrious Hector. [790] When they were got together, they first quenched the fire with
            wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and comrades with many a bitter tear
            gathered his white bones, [795] and laid them in a golden urn— <seg rend="subscript"
              >796</seg> covering his body with purple robes— which they placed in a grave [<foreign
              xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] and covered over with large stones set close together.
            Then they built a tomb [<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">sēma</foreign>] hurriedly over it
            keeping guard on every side [800] lest the strong-greaved Achaeans should attack them
            before they had finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again into
            the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the house of Priam, their
            king. </p>
          <p>Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector, tamer of horses.</p>
